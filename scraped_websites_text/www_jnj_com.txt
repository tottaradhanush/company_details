So, his mother secured him an apprenticeship at her family’s pharmacy, Wood & Tittamer, in Poughkeepsie, New York.Wood & Tittamer This is a photo of the Wood & Tittamer pharmacy where Johnson first apprenticed. Owned by his mother’s cousin, the business was both a wholesale and retail drugstore. Wood & Tittamer pharmacy, 19th century.Johnson & Johnson Archives The American pharmacy The pharmacy trade went beyond distributing medicine; it included mixing products and recommending treatments. Many Americans viewed their local pharmacist as a trusted advisor and a first point of contact, even before a physician. Pharmacy, circa 1860sJohnson & Johnson Archives There, he learned the business of mixing medicated plasters, which launched his career in the growing industry of medical products. Probably no other branch of the pharmaceutical art has been the occasion of so much toil, anxiety, and failure and discouragement before any measure of success was met...Expressive expletives could not be restrained. Robert Wood Johnson On mixing ingredients for medicinal plasters, 1894 Johnson & Johnson Archives What is a medicated plaster? Medicated plasters were popular 19th-century products: they were adhesive patches that delivered medicine directly through the skin. Medicated plasters were used to treat a variety of ailments, including pain and inflammation. Photographer unknown/Museum of the City of New York. X2010.11.625 1864 Following his apprenticeship, Johnson’s first stop was New York City, where he worked as a pharmaceutical wholesaler. This photograph of Lower Manhattan in the 1860s was taken only blocks from Johnson’s office within a few years of his move to New York City.1875 Seabury & Johnson rapidly expanded, and within a few short years, had become one of the most widely recognized medicated plaster brands in the world.

Johnson was among the 10 millions people who visited the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia and he was also drawn to the World’s Fair by its International Medical Congress, the largest gathering of doctors in American history to date.1876 Johnson was among the 10 million people who visited the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia. He was in part drawn to the World’s Fair by its International Medical Congress, the largest gathering of doctors in American history to date.Johnson represented his company at the fair. It was there that he listened to Dr. Joseph Lister explain his radical, new procedure: antiseptic surgery.What visitors saw In a pre-internet age, world’s fairs were centers of learning and entertainment. Exhibition halls featuring live animals and people, as well as demonstrations of the latest technology and innovations that captured visitors’ imaginations.

Library of Congress 1 of 4 1876 Johnson represented his company at the fair. It was there that he listened to Dr. Joseph Lister explain his radical, new procedure: antiseptic surgery. Without strict antiseptic treatment, it is impossible to freely lay open a knee-joint, with the certainty that no danger will follow. Sir Joseph Lister, from his remarks made on antiseptic surgery, International Medical Congress, Philadelphia, PA, 1876. Surgery during the Civil War Before surgery was more sterile, more than half of patients died from operations. So, Lister traveled the world to spread the idea that surgery could be made safer through antiseptic practices. Doctor performing surgery to set a broken leg during the Civil War, 1863 ©CORBIS/Corbis via Getty Images Lister promoted new surgical tools and methods, including handwashing, sterilizing instruments, and covering wounds with antiseptic-soaked dressings. 1876 While many doctors in the audience were skeptical of Lister’s surgery, Johnson was convinced that it was the future of medicine. Chapter 3 1886 Chapter 3 1886 So inspired by Lister’s antiseptic methods, Johnson parted ways with his business partner, Seabury, and started Johnson & Johnson with his two younger brothers, Edward Mead and James Wood in 1886. Their company manufactured the world’s first mass-produced, sterile surgical supplies.The three brothers formed a formidable team. We are all fortunate, in that we are engaged in manufacturing products to be used throughout the world for the relief of pain and suffering. Robert Wood Johnson, 1908 Robert brought to the table his business acumen and product design expertise. Edward’s strength lay in advertising. Edward led early company ad campaigns (like this one for Wood’s Penetrating Plaster) offering creative direction. James was a talented engineer who designed inventive machines. Does This Signature Look Familiar? It belongs to James Wood Johnson and his handwriting inspired the historical Johnson & Johnson script logo. 1 of 5 1886 On a brisk January day in 1886, James found himself aboard a train passing through New Brunswick, New Jersey. He looked out his window and noticed a “for rent” sign on a nearby factory building.That building became Johnson & Johnson’s first home. It opened its doors with just 14 employees: eight women and six men. Today, the company’s world headquarters remains in New Brunswick. The Old Railroad Tracks: Johnson’s train stopped at the railroad depot several blocks from where this photograph was taken.New Brunswick Free Public Library A look inside early factories Johnson & Johnson Archives Women employees at Johnson & Johnson, 1890s Johnson & Johnson early shipping department employees Johnson & Johnson Archives 1886 Johnson & Johnson manufactured the world’s first sterile surgical products, including sutures, absorbent cotton, and gauze. Ready-made dressings decreased infection rates and saved lives. Keeping products sterile To manufacture sterile surgical products, Johnson & Johnson employees took many precautions to ensure both their environment and their hands were clean. Each product was then labeled with explicit directions on how to keep it germ-free. Johnson & Johnson Archives A new kind of cotton Johnson & Johnson was a pioneer of sterile absorbent cotton, a groundbreaking product of its day. The cotton was packed in sheets that were easily wrapped around wounds to protect them from germs. 1 of 2 Chapter 4 1888-1890 Chapter 4 Towards modern medicine 1888 The Johnson brothers soon discovered that manufacturing sterile supplies was not enough—they needed to teach doctors how to use them. In 1888, the company published Modern Methods of Antiseptic Wound Treatment, a how-to guide on antiseptic surgery.Explore modern methods Introducing Frederick Kilmer This project was spearheaded by Frederick B. Kilmer, a respected New Brunswick pharmacist and public health pioneer, who, only a year later, joined Johnson & Johnson as its scientific director. Fred Kilmer – a strong supporter of nursing and nurse training. Johnson & Johnson Archives Spreading germ theory Modern Methods taught doctors that invisible germs caused infection. The book persuaded with statistics and anecdotes, showing how post-op deaths plummeted when surgeries were performed using Lister’s methods. Johnson & Johnson Archives Sterile surgery in the kitchen Though Lister’s theory had gained traction, many surgeries were still performed at home. Modern Methods included a section that instructed local physicians on how to transform a kitchen table into a sterile operating table. Common dishware, including a soup tureen, could be cleaned and sterilized and was suggested to hold equipment. Johnson & Johnson Archives 1 of 3 The Operating Table—The ordinary kitchen table will generally answer,” explained Modern Methods. “Bricks or wooden blocks should be placed under two legs of the table in order that the irrigating liquids may drain off toward the pail used for catching them. Modern Methods of Antiseptic Wound Treatment, Johnson & Johnson, 1888, pp. 4-5 1888 Itinerant salesmen traveled far and wide to distribute Modern Methods of Antiseptic Wound Treatment across the U.S. Within a matter of months, they’d given out 85,000 copies to doctors and pharmacists.Modern Methods of Antiseptic Wound Treatment was hailed as a major contribution to the field. It also served as a sales guide for Johnson & Johnson’s early surgical products, which were listed among the back pages.Johnson & Johnson made inexpensive, quality products. In 1888, most of their surgical supplies cost a fraction of a physician’s weekly earnings, allowing for further adoption of sterile surgical practices.The guide helped spread germ theory and antiseptic surgical methods. Just 13 years earlier, in 1875, surgeons had operated in street clothes and worked with unclean hands. Dispensing Modern Methods: Company salesmen traveled by rail and horseback up the coasts and along remote frontier outposts to distribute Modern Methods. Johnson & Johnson Archives Johnson & Johnson’s horse-drawn fleet: These early drivers delivered company products to customers and to port. From 1902 to 1936, the company also had its own fleet of steamboats to take its products to port. Johnson & Johnson Archives 1989 By 1889, many surgeons had adopted Lister’s methods. Here, a team of surgeons in 1889 accompanied by a nurse wears white uniforms and uses sterilized tools.Dr. Agnew, Sterile Surgeon Dr. David Hayes Agnew was a pioneering American surgeon who championed Lister’s antiseptic methods. A veteran surgeon of the Civil War, Agnew was also a contributor to Johnson & Johnson’s Modern Methods of Antiseptic Wound Treatment. He devoted the later years of his illustrious career to teaching sterile practices in the operating theater.

Etching, Gebbie & Husson, after Thomas Eakins painting of Dr. Hayes Agnew, circa 1889. 1892 Johnson & Johnson helped make sterile surgery a reality. Since its founding in 1886, the company had by the 1890s revolutionized the field of medicine, manufacturing the world’s first mass-produced antiseptic medical supplies. Kilmer founded the company’s Aseptic Department in the early 1890s. The department was a series of “clean rooms” where sterile surgical dressings and sutures were mass-produced in sterile conditions and sterilized using the first industrial-size machinery for the task, also of Kilmer’s design.

Johnson & Johnson Archives 1890 During the 1890s, the company continued to refine these supplies and reach new milestones in the field, continuing in the 20th century through product innovation and strategic acquisitions to become a world leader in healthcare.
