Decommissioned platform transforms into reef — Chevron skip to main content close subscribe to our newsletter to receive news and updates. sign up now our operations decommissioned platform transforms into reef 1 min read | march 19, 2025 Chevron has turned its former Genesis Platform into an artificial reef for marine life. Erin Englert sometimes wishes she were a scuba diver so she could plunge deep into the U.S. Gulf of America and see the results of her work. As a Chevron regulatory affairs advisor, she facilitates programs that transform decommissioned oil and gas platforms into marine life habitats. A recent project involved turning the spar, or hull, of the former Genesis Platform into a gathering spot for creatures like coral, tropical fish and anemones. “I’ve seen videos and pictures of the results, and it’s just beautiful. I would love to go down there and visit one.” erin englert regulatory affairs advisor why it matters Marine life is attracted to offshore platforms, and state officials want the structures to continue to provide ecological benefits when decommissioned. “Fish are reliant upon them as a habitat,” said Mike McDonough, artificial reef program coordinator with the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries. “It’s rewarding to see them thrive.” The Genesis spar that was submerged and converted into an artificial reef in the U.S. Gulf of America. sunken treasure Last year, the Genesis’ spar was submerged deep off Louisiana’s coast, just as other decommissioned structures had been before it. It’s not unusual for platform energy industry components to be repurposed. For instance, in 2022, Chevron’s Pascagoula Refinery donated equipment for use as artificial reefs. The spar, the cylinder-shaped hull of the platform, was towed nearly 70 miles and submerged at one of Louisiana’s existing reef sites. legacy project In its previous life, Genesis was considered an offshore gamechanger. Its innovative 705-foot, 28,700-ton steel floating spar was the first to house both drilling and production facilities. The platform’s transformation is allowing it to live on in a new, underwater world. “It’s bittersweet,” said Casey Voisin, offshore installation manager, who worked on the platform for approximately seven years. “I’m glad I got to see her away and help her find her new purpose. I am honored to have been a part of it.” topics covered our operations related content chevron uses AI to bring reliable energy to data centers our operationsmarch 14, 2025 US companies make bold move to power nation’s data centers our operationsfebruary 13, 2025 explainer: where do oil and gas come from? our operationsdecember 30, 2024 gas development opportunities in sub-saharan Africa our operationsdecember 20, 2024 view archive chevron email updates Subscribe to our newsletter to receive news and updates. sign up for the newsletter
Chevron leaders share their vision for the future at CERAweek 2025 — Chevron skip to main content close subscribe to our newsletter to receive news and updates. sign up now chevron leaders share their vision for the future at CERAWeek 2025 Mike Wirth, Chevron chairman and CEO (right), spoke at CERAWeek 2025. As demand for reliable, affordable, lower carbon intensity energy continues to rise from its current all-time high, leaders from Chevron took center stage at the 2025 CERAWeek conference, the energy industry’s foremost annual gathering, with important messages about the future of energy. Their comments focused on three main themes: Chevron is working to meet rising energy needs by increasing production across its operations. Both globally and in the U.S., 2024 was Chevron’s highest-production year to date. Transforming the global energy system will require ingenuity and innovation. AI is transforming the energy landscape—not only because AI data centers require a lot of energy to operate, but also because AI tools are changing the way that companies like Chevron do business. Here are some topics that Chevron leaders discussed at CERAWeek 2025: mike wirth, chevron chairman and ceo Addressing industry leaders at CERAWeek 2025, Mike Wirth spoke about Chevron’s increasing production. Watch the full discussion. Key takeaways: 2024 was Chevron’s most productive year to date: production was up 7% overall and nearly 20% in the U.S., and the company returned a record $27 billion to shareholders. Chevron is poised to, over the next two years, grow free cash flow by as much as $10 billion. Chevron is tracking to grow 10% in the Permian Basin, while growth in the Gulf of America is projected to increase from 200,000 barrels per day to 300,000 barrels per day by the end of 2026. Without action and innovation, AI’s high energy requirements may strain current energy systems. Chevron is poised to provide reliable, abundant energy to power AI data centers, thanks in part to the fact that it is scaling production of natural gas. “We’ll be over a million barrels a day in the Permian this year. Kazakhstan and our big project there will be a million barrels a day.” mike wirth chevron chairman and ceo andy walz, president of downstream, midstream & chemicals Andy Walz spoke at the CERAWeek spotlight session “Transportation Fuel in a Shifting Demand Landscape.” Key takeaways: Many forms of energy will be needed to power transportation in the future, and Chevron is currently making investments with an eye not only on today’s transportation environment, but also on possible changes in the decades ahead. Durable policies are needed to enable new products—including hydrogen and biodiesel—and to encourage consumers to buy them. “I’m encouraged by the conversation that happened this week. It does seem to be more balanced, reinforcing how energy must be affordable, it has to be reliable for security reasons and, yes, we always have to make it cleaner.” andy walz presidentdownstream, midstream & chemicals balaji krishnamurthy, vice president of chevron technical center Balaji Krishnamurthy spoke at the CERAWeek strategic roundtable “AI for Energy, Energy for AI.” Key takeaways: AI allows Chevron to leverage vast amounts of data to make faster, higher-quality decisions that drive better business results. Data that once took a lot of time uncover is now almost instantly available to Chevron’s practitioners. AI tools are helping Chevron in its efforts to lower the carbon intensity of its operations. At the same time, AI tools are also helping Chevron in its efforts to make operations safer for workers. AI acceleration is increasing demand for energy to power data centers, and natural gas provides the fastest time-to-market for reliable and scalable power. When combined with carbon capture and storage, natural gas is also a lower carbon intensity solution. “AI can be the technology breakthrough needed to deliver an affordable, reliable and ever-cleaner energy system.” balaji krishnamurthy vice presidentchevron technical center jim gable, vice president of innovation and president of chevron technology ventures Jim Gable spoke at the CERAWeek session “Financing the Future: Scaling Clean Energy through Innovative Investment Strategies.” Key takeaways: Energy solutions must scale, and Chevron has unique capabilities to do just that. Established companies have the ability to scale new technologies, integrate them into existing operations, and provide the necessary capital and capabilities to bring these innovations to market. Collaboration is increasingly important to close innovation gaps and integrate emerging technologies into existing value chains. The technologies where you have to build an entire market, a whole new value chain, are the challenging ones. “Innovation is at the heart of our strategy, enabling us to stay ahead of industry trends and deliver value to our stakeholders.” jim gable vice president of innovationpresident of chevron technology ventures learn more about the topics chevron leaders discussed at CERAWeek chevron email updates Subscribe to our newsletter to receive news and updates. sign up for the newsletter
