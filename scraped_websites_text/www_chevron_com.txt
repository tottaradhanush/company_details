Our History | Chevron — Chevron skip to main content a history of enabling human progress We’ve always believed in the power of human ingenuity. A group of explorers successfully struck oil in California in 1876. Three years later our company entered the industry in 1879. Our spirit has been driven by integrity, trust, and innovation. And we’ve continued our purpose to provide the affordable, reliable, ever-cleaner energy that enables human progress. read the full chevron history 1879 - 1911 leading the way 1912 - 1926 spirit of standard 1927 - 1946 in war and peace 1947 - 1979 a new identity 1980 - 2001 market expansion 2002 - 2019 a new era of energy 2020 - present advancing energy progress 1879 - 1911 leading the way A quest for black gold brings a spirit of innovation and transformative engineering. 1879 Before we became Chevron, we got our start in San Francisco under the name Pacific Coast Oil Co. (PCO). After PCO incorporated, it acquired California Star Oil Works Co. 1895 California’s first steel-hulled tanker, the George Loomis, was built to efficiently transport 6,500 barrels of oil by sea. 1900 Standard Oil Company acquired PCO. This acquisition gave Standard Oil Company a supply of oil for the U.S. West Coast. It also added production, transportation, and refining capabilities. Early 1900s The first oil refinery PCO built was at Alameda Point, California in 1880. Additional refineries were built decades later in California and transformed the landscape of West Coast energy. 1907 The world’s first service station was set up in Seattle by Socal sales manager John McLean. 1879 A few years before the acquisition, oil was discovered by California Star Oil Works at drill site No. 4 in Pico Canyon. This marked California’s earliest commercial oil discovery. The site produced oil until 1990, a state record. Early 1900s 1902The Richmond Refinery was built in Northern California. It used a new process to make salable, inexpensive kerosene from crude oil. Previously, refined California crude oil made a smoky kerosene that was inferior to the western U.S. version. 1911The El Segundo Refinery was built in Southern California. Car sales were booming across much of the U.S. West Coast. And El Segundo’s location overlooking the azure Pacific Ocean made it ideal for transoceanic shipments. The location also gave the company access to Southern California oil fields. 1907 This service station was at the company’s sales plant on the property, so customers could purchase gas at a trusted location. Early service stations had products displayed on wooden shelves along with a curbside gasoline dispenser. Safety has also been a core value from the beginning as shown here with the No Smoking sign. 1912 - 1926 spirit of standard As demand for petroleum products grew, so did our competitive drive and passion for change. 1912 Led by Standard Oil Company’s (California) director of producing Fred Hillman, crews at the McNee No. 4 well at the Midway-Sunset oil field in California produced a record 30,000 barrels a day. 1916 This group of employees at the Richmond Refinery were the first to receive service pins after the announcement of the inauguration of the Order of Service. 1926 Standard Oil Company of California (Socal) sponsored the Standard Hour, the first network radio broadcast of symphonic music on the U.S. West Coast. It gave rise two years later to the Standard School Broadcast that reached millions of grade school students for decades. 1916 The “Standard Oil Spirit” booklet was developed for employees and laid out our company’s progressive values and policies. It also helped establish our culture and guided how we work. 1926 The Standard School Broadcast is one of the earliest educational radio programs. It was presented by our company as a public service. This was a music broadcast for students and music lovers to be enjoyed in classrooms and homes in many states across the U.S., including Alaska and Hawaii. 1927 - 1946 in war and peace The impact of low oil supplies after World War I prompted our efforts to produce oil worldwide and grow our business. 1927 Charles Lindbergh used Socal’s Red Crown gasoline for his Spirit of St. Louis trans-Atlantic flight. “I found I could buy special gasoline in the West that would give me a little more range per gallon,” he said. 1931 Socal introduced the chevron-shaped hallmark logo to standardize brand identity and set itself apart from competitors. The sign was displayed at all 900 Socal service stations on the U.S. West Coast. 1930s Socal oil discoveries in the Middle East transformed energy production and expanded business operations. 1941 Socal became a key supplier of crude oil for the Allies during World War II. Women broke new ground and played an important role by working in refineries, laboratories, and service stations as men enlisted in the armed services. 1927 On his 9,500-mile tour, Lindbergh flew from Washington, D.C., to Mexico, Guatemala, British Honduras, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, Venezuela, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, Hati, and Cuba. 1931 1940Socal adopted the Chevron Sign along with the words Quality Service to signify the Sign of Fine Products. 1945Socal introduced winged-V Chevron signs at dealer service stations. 1930s 1932Socal discovered oil in Bahrain, the company’s first international oil discovery. 1938Socal made the first major oil discovery in Saudi Arabia. 1941 Socal’s Richmond Refinery was awarded the Army-Navy “E” for excellence four times during World War II for its record production supporting the war effort. Socal refineries supported the war effort by making a variety of products. Including fuels used by military aircrafts. This trophy held the company’s billionth gallon of 100 octane gasoline. 1947 - 1979 a new identity Our company expanded internationally to meet growing oil demands. 1949 Socal’s oil discoveries in Indonesia and offshore waters of the Gulf of America helped our company become one of the largest oil producers. 1961 Socal merged with Kentucky Standard Oil (KYSO). 1969 Socal introduced a modernized hallmark design to communicate company identity worldwide. 1961 The Pascagoula Refinery was built as a result of the KYSO acquisition to supply oil to new markets. 1980 - 2001 market expansion We continued to grow around the world through mergers, acquisitions, and marketing efforts. 1984 Socal merged with Gulf Oil Corporation, nearly doubling our oil and natural gas reserves worldwide. 1984 Socal became Chevron Corporation to align our company identity globally. 1995 Chevron launched the iconic “Chevron Cars” advertising campaign. And it continues to evolve today. 1995 “The Chevron Way” became the company vision, linking our company’s vision and values to the way we do business. 1999 Chevron became one of the first companies to endorse the Global Sullivan Principles for universal human rights. 2001 Chevron merged with Texaco and became ChevronTexaco, the second-largest U.S.-based energy company at the time. 2001 Chevron set up the Office of Global Diversity to promote diversity and inclusion inside the company. 1984 Gulf Oil Corp. was the nation’s fifth-largest petroleum producer when acquired. Through the merger, major exploration and production operations were expanded in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, Canada, and the North Sea. The Gulf brand itself presently is owned by third parties. 1995 2002 - 2019 a new era of energy As our exploration technology expanded, so did our aim to support diversity and inclusion. 2005 ChevronTexaco acquired Unocal Corporation and became Chevron. We also introduced a more approachable hallmark logo. The design built on heritage and conveyed a sense of momentum and warmth. 2016 In pursuit of its long-term energy goals, Chevron advanced two liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects, Gorgon and Wheatstone, which moved forward in Western Australia. 2005 2007Chevron launched the “Power of Human Energy,” a campaign focused on connecting people with current energy issues. 2019Chevron debuted a new hallmark logo that redefines “human energy” for a new era. This new hallmark was based on three concepts—humanity has the power to solve any challenge, our company’s work helps make human progress possible, and we can deliver results the right and responsible way. 2016 The loading jetties located at the Gorgon facility, Barrow Island, Australia. View of the Wheatstone Offshore Platform topsides at dawn. 2020 - present advancing energy progress Working toward a lower carbon future. Early 2020s As Chevron continued to grow through acquisitions, so did our vision for the future. 2021 Chevron New Energies was introduced to help customers meet their lower carbon goals and reduce the carbon intensity of our own operations. 2022 Chevron held over 4,800 technology patents, making it one of the leading patent holders in our industry. 2024 Chevron announces move of corporate headquarters from San Ramon, CA to Houston, TX. 2020s 2020Chevron acquired Noble Energy and Puma Energy. This gave us a larger oil-supply at lower cost and made our collection of assets stronger in the Eastern Mediterranean. 2022Chevron acquired Renewable Energy Group (REG). This helped provide lower-carbon solutions for transportation. Leveraging our existing refining system, we aim to grow our renewable fuels production capacity to roughly 100,000 barrels per day by 2030. 2023Chevron announced agreement to acquire PDC Energy and Hess Energy. The PDC gain increased our oil supply by 10% and supports our strategy to leverage our strengths to safely deliver lower carbon energy to a growing world. read the full chevron history newsroom latest in chevron March 24, 2025 chevron and new orleans score big at the big game read article March 19, 2025 decommissioned platform transforms into reef read article March 18, 2025 chevron leaders share their vision for the future at CERAWeek 2025 read article March 17, 2025 chevron responds to los angeles county wildfires read article March 14, 2025 chevron uses AI to bring reliable energy to data centers read article resources 2023 climate change resilience report 2024 supplement to the annual report 2023 annual report 2023 corporate sustainability report the chevron way - english chevron email updates subscribe to our newsletter to receive news and updates

Customers can be confident in our ability to serve their needs with an entrepreneurial mindset, as we help build the lower carbon energy system of tomorrow.” Jeff Gustavson President of Chevron New Energies ccus hydrogen renewables carbon offsets emerging technologies leadership in the news connect with us portfolio our portfolio ccus carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) Carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) is a critical enabler of global net zero and our commitment to accelerate progress toward the lower carbon ambitions of our customers and company. Chevron has decades of operational experience and a proven track record of carbon-capture projects and is already deploying CCUS technologies in locations across the globe. We’re taking action by deploying CCUS to lower the carbon intensity of our existing assets and growing our CCUS business to help reduce emissions of the essential industries that enable modern society. We are leveraging our expertise and global reach to advance CCUS technologies and scaling viable lower carbon solutions across the value chain (capture, transport, utilization, and storage) with a focus on hard-to-abate, energy-intensive industries such as refining, petrochemicals, power, steel and cement. We operate Gorgon, one of the world’s largest integrated CCS projects. Since the system started up in mid-2019, over 10.5 million tonnes of CO2 emissions have been injected as of 2022. We are investing in emerging CCUS technologies to bring early insights through pilot programs – often using Chevron’s existing assets – and to accelerate commercialization of promising technologies. To achieve our ambitions, we are also exploring hub opportunities in the United States and abroad. learn more about our carbon capturing and storage learn more about our CCUS partnerships and projects View the CCUS fact sheet hydrogen hydrogen Chevron believes in the value of delivering large-scale hydrogen solutions that support a lower carbon world. We aim to deliver lower carbon energy to a growing world by creating a profitable, large-scale, lower carbon hydrogen business that builds on our existing assets, capabilities, and customers. We’re well positioned to participate across the value chain to supply industrial, power and heavy-duty transportation customers. Chevron currently produces approximately 1 million tonnes per year of hydrogen through our traditional business and has experience in retail hydrogen going back to 2005. Chevron holds more than 75 patents from early commercial ventures that are applicable to our future development plans. We produce approximately 1 million tonnes of hydrogen per year for use in our refining operations. Further, we have the potential to supply and sell hydrogen to customers from our existing refineries by leveraging our distribution capabilities, sales channels and brands. We are currently building hydrogen fueling stations at select locations. We’re exploring profitable opportunities for growth across the value chain, from upstream production through distribution into transportation, power generation and other industrial sectors. We are also evaluating using hydrogen as an alternative for industries dependent on combustible fuels and assessing development of hydrogen production hubs. And, we are leveraging our capabilities in carbon capture, utilization, and storage to unlock market opportunities for hydrogen solutions. learn more about our hydrogen partnerships and projects renewables renewable fuels and products Renewable fuels are important products that can help reduce the lifecycle carbon intensity of transportation fuels while meeting the world’s growing energy needs. We are responsive to our customers who will increasingly need renewable fuels and products like renewable natural gas, hydrogen, renewable diesel, sustainable aviation fuel and renewable base oils and lubricants. learn more about fuel solutions carbonoffsets carbon offsets Carbon offsets are expected to play an important role in global carbon reductions, especially in sectors that do not have cost-effective reduction opportunities or for activities where emissions are harder to abate. Chevron’s experience in developing and using carbon offsets dates back nearly two decades. We have a global carbon trading organization and actively invest in scalable, nature-based solutions – like soil carbon storage, reforestation, and mangrove restoration – to build a portfolio of high-quality credits. We are growing a carbon offsets business to help achieve our net zero ambitions, and we are working to provide verified, low-cost, high-integrity offsets to our customers around the world in an effort to help them achieve their own lower carbon goals. As global demand grows, we expect to be a supplier of offsets by providing customers with offset-paired products. Carbon offsets are available now for use, and they can also be integrated with other lower carbon solutions to help maximize efficiency. learn more about our carbon offsets partnerships and projects emergingtechnologies emerging technologies Chevron has a long history of identifying and driving innovation through investments in emerging technologies, research and development, and university partnerships. We are currently exploring opportunities to commercialize the next generation of emerging technologies. Initially, we are leveraging core capabilities in subsurface, drilling, wells and facilities, and our operating history in geothermal, to advance and scale novel geothermal energy, which can potentially allow access to a widespread baseload, nonintermittent resource that can complement and add capacity to meet the world’s growing renewable-power demand. In addition to geothermal, we are exploring other emerging lower carbon power technologies, such as lithium extraction. Technologies such as long-duration storage or small, modular nuclear reactors can be part of the solutions needed to deliver on the world’s growing demand for lower carbon energy.
