Serendipitous momentsSocial effortsInnovative productsRevolutionary techEveryday practicesPutting people firstSustainable effortsMoments of brillianceSerendipitous strokes of genius and passion-fueled ideas launched iconic brands and defined us as a company. OUR FUTURE Open Call for Ideas Our Connect + Develop program helps us partner with innovators around the world to solve problems for our consumers’ needs. Learn more. 2000 A Food Wrap That Whitens Teeth: Glad Press’n Seal & Crest Whitestrips To combat plastic wrap that loses its grip, P&G develops a technology to create Glad Press’n Seal. At the same time, a young employee working on at-home teeth whitening products connects with his mentor who shares a prototype of the food wrap with him. Sparked by this new idea, they cut the wrap into small strips, and apply it to their teeth. Shortly after, Crest Whitestrips is developed. 1998 One Insight That Led to Easier Cleaning for All: Always & Swiffer Wet Jet A consumer explained to a Products Researcher that while she liked Mr. Clean liquid, it didn’t make the cleaning process any easier. She opened her broom closet—full of mops, brushes, and buckets—and asked him to clean that up. Our researchers combine our capabilities in highly absorbent non-wovens, like the ones used in Always and Pampers, with our cleaner solutions expertise, creating both the Swiffer Wet Jet and the Quick Clean category. 1973 A Softener for the Dryer: Bounce With the addition of dryers in homes, static cling becomes a key issue. P&G finds a new way to deliver fabric softener via a towel. Research quickly led us to an inventor who had already figured it out, and we acquired the technology. Bounce dryer sheets are introduced as a fresh alternative to liquid fabric softeners. 12341961 A Grandfather Inspired by His Grandson: Pampers While watching his first grandchild, a P&G researcher quickly realizes the mess of cloth diapers and the need to carry them until returning home. This leads him and fellow researchers to develop a better & more affordable disposable diaper. Since then, Pampers has continuously advanced—moving from pins to tapes, becoming thinner and more cloth-like, and designed for babies at every stage of development. 1894 A Father's Concern: VapoRub A pharmacist developed several home remedies, such as cough syrups and other liquids that he sold in his local store. One day his infant son became ill. Unsure any of the ingestible products would be effective, he creates an externally-applied salve that releases cough-soothing vapors when heated by the body. His son’s health improves, and generations around the world grow up with VapoRub. 12A corporate force for goodOur employees have been the driving force behind our support for our environment, communities, and people—a practice that has been ingrained in our culture for over a century. OUR FUTURE Building Our Impact Each year, we actively continue to integrate Citizenship into how we do business. The more we do that, the bigger the impact we can make with the people we serve, the communities where we live and work, and the broader world that surrounds us. See what we’re up to now. 2015 Always’ #LikeAGirl The 2015 Super Bowl’s most-liked commercial changes the conversation about girls and sports, taking an unintentionally derogatory phrase and making it one of empowerment, strength, and pride. Millions of girls around the world rally to change #LikeAGirl to mean amazing things. This massive engagement starts to change public perception: while only 19% of girls had a positive association with the phrase “like a girl” before the campaign, 76% agree they no longer view the phrase as an insult after watching the Always #LikeAGirl film. 2012 Summer Olympics Campaign After the success of our 2010 “Proud Sponsor of Moms” campaign, we launch “Thank You, Mom"—a campaign where we support 150 global athletes and their Moms. When asked in what way we can help them most, Moms respond that they'd like to see us support youth sports. For this reason, we commit to raising $25 million globally. 2012 Honored in the Community The United Way—a non-profit organization that fights for health, education, and financial stability—celebrates its 125th Anniversary and awards us with The Spirit of America Award, their highest national honor for any corporation. We have always placed an emphasis on supporting the communities where we’re located, starting with Cincinnati’s first coordinated community charity in 1915 following devastating floods in the region. 12342005 Tide Loads of Hope The program is launched to help families hit by natural disaster by washing, drying, and folding laundry for them. By 2012, we cleaned more than 34,000 loads of laundry for families affected by disasters, including Hurricane Katrina, the San Diego wildfires, Hurricane Ike and more. In 2017 alone, the Tide Loads of Hope program washes 3,100 loads of laundry. 2004 Children's Safe Drinking Water An employee looks into cleaning water so moms in an African village could do laundry easier. As his team works on a way to reuse the wash water, they leverage P&G laundry technology and soon realize they could get it so clean you could drink it. So instead of laundry, they bring families clean drinking water—a much more important need. 1978 Dawn Wildlife Rescue International Bird Rescue begins testing all major dish soaps for cleaning and discovers that Dawn works the best. It’s the only product strong enough to remove the oil, yet gentle enough to not harm the integrity of the feathers. Since then, P&G has donated over 50,000 bottles and helped more than 75,000 animals. 123Products that broke the moldP&G history is full of never-before-seen innovations that solved problems and inspired the industry to catch up. OUR FUTURE Inventing the Products We Need Partnering with experts & innovators inside and outside our walls, we’re identifying what consumer needs aren’t being met, and developing tech to solve them. Check out what we’re working on now. 2001 The First Razor Designed Specifically for Women For the first time, Gillette asks women about their shaving experience, not just their shaving needs. Venus is developed after recognizing the key differences between men’s and women’s shaving. Using our best blades, Venus incorporates rounded cartridges, anti-bacterial rubber, and in-shower ergonomics and packaging. 1961 Dandruff, Solved Consumers were dissatisfied with existing anti-dandruff shampoos. After 10 years of research, our scientists discovered Pyrithione Zinc, an ingredient that reduces dandruff. We introduce it as Head & Shoulders in 1961 and it quickly becomes one of P&G’s biggest brands. In 1988, we launch is as our first brand in China. 1955 Preventing Tooth Decay Our researchers collaborate with Indiana University to develop the first stable fluoride toothpaste. Crest is introduced and becomes the first toothpaste with fluoride clinically proven to fight cavities and help prevent tooth decay—the second-most prevalent disease at the time. We also start reaching out to dentists, enlisting them to help prevent oral care issues rather than just repairing them—dramatically changing the way people think about taking care of their teeth. In 1960, the American Dental Association recognizes Crest as effective against cavities, catapulting the brands credibility. 12341949 The Soft Toothbrush A California dentist invents Oral-B toothbrushes using soft nylon bristles, out of concern for his patients gums. As a small entrepreneur, he sells them only to his dentist friends who in turn recommend the brand to their patients. Oral-B will grow to become one of the largest global brush brands. 1946 Tide, The Washday Miracle In 1933, Dreft is introduced as the first-ever household synthetic detergent, but research continues to develop a product that can clean consumer’s toughest stains. After almost a decade of failed work, the project is ordered to stop. But for 7 years, the lead researcher secretly works on the product in his spare time. By 1946, he has created a game changing product which is introduced as Tide. Called “The Washday Miracle”, it cleans better than anything on the market. 1879 The Soap That Floats James N. Gamble, son of the founder, recognizes that families must have 2 different bars of soap—one for laundry and one for bathing. He creates an innovative single bar of soap that works for both purposes. Named Ivory Soap, it takes the country by storm as one of the company’s most legendary brands. 123Tech that revolutionized the industryIf there’s one thing we know, it’s that there’s always a smarter, more efficient, simply better way of doing things. This principle has led to P&G products that have changed the way categories think. OUR FUTURE Keeping the Gears Moving We’re constantly working to propel the industry into the future whether it’s with product and packaging innovations, coming up with creative ways to use data, or finding ways to reinvent our business model. 2012 Tide Pods Designed as a detergent + stain remover + brightener in one, Tide Pods breaks through the laundry category. The pods deliver a new formula in a small dose that is HE compatible and twice as compacted as the current 2x Tide Liquid. 1998 Changing the Aircare Category One the biggest unmet consumer needs is finding a way to clean things that can’t go into the washing machine. With that problem in mind Procter & Gamble invents Febreze, a product that doesn’t just cover up bad scent, but actually removes it. 1986 Invention of 2-in-1 Our researchers set out to perfect a formula that cleans, lathers, rinses, and conditions in one convenient step. After more than three years of work, we launch the first “2-in-1” shampoo and conditioner on the market and expand that technology to Head & Shoulders, Pantene, and Vidal Sassoon. 12341965 A New Way to Make Paper Recognizing that people could only buy paper that was either soft or strong, Charmin creates a new way to allow for both in the same tissue, calling it CPF. With this new technology comes the famous ad campaign, “Please don’t squeeze the Charmin”. 1901 Improving the Razor King C. Gillette patents the KC Gillette Razor, an alternative to the straight razor. A breakthrough in the category, its permanent handle and disposable blade provides men with a safe and convenient way to shave. 12Practices that improve people's livesProviding customers with quality products that make every day better has driven our purpose for over 180 years. OUR FUTURE Ingredient Transparency We’re committed to continuing to be transparent about the ingredients we use (and don’t use) so that you can be confident when you add P&G products to your cart. See our fragrance ingredients list here. 2007 P&G in Your Neighborhood Tide Dry Cleaners launches in 2008 and is P&G’s big move into the service industry. It is quickly franchised across the country and in the first two years, serves over 500,000 customers, processes over 3.4 million garments, and creates over 150 jobs. 1941 Talking to Consumers We become one of the first companies to formally respond to consumer correspondence. By 1974, toll-free phone numbers allow consumers to contact us directly. By the 1990s, we incorporate email, and by the 2000s, social media makes connecting with consumers easier than ever. In 2011, we invent a listening solution which lets brands monitor what people are saying about their products in real-time. 1924 Start of Market Research D. Paul "Doc" Smelser, a Ph.D. economist from Johns Hopkins University, joins the team. He collects statistical data breaking out consumers by income and background, making us the first company to conduct deliberate, data-based market research with consumers. This allows us to improve consumer understanding and anticipate their needs to create products that improve everyday life. 12341890 First R&D Lab R&D quickly becomes a critical function at P&G and our first lab is added to the Ivorydale facility. By the 1920s, R&D is an integrated division of our company, employing a staff of several hundred young men and women. The Research Department develops ways to improve products, then passes their findings on to be translated into new manufacturing processes. 1887 Honest Business Ethics P&G products, known for their reputation for quality and being made by a company built on ethics, begin to be recognized through the slogan “Highest Grade, Honest Weight”. A retailer in Chicago, Illinois carries nothing but P&G products due to the demand for trusted products. 1886 An Industrial Masterpiece After a disastrous fire at our first plant, Ivorydale is purposefully built as a modern manufacturing facility. Designed by one of the nation's foremost industrial architects, Solon Beman, the new plant incorporates the latest designs for the safety and comfort of employees. We spend the next 130+ years expanding these manufacturing principles across the globe. 123A company that puts people firstWhat allows us to be one of the largest consumer goods company in the world is filling our buildings with passionate, inspired, motivated people who believe in doing better than good, every day. OUR FUTURE Diversity in Everything We Do We believe in diversity & inclusion. That’s why we support it however we can—from creating flexible work schedules for our employees to building inclusive playgrounds for children with and without disabilities. Learn more about our efforts. 2005 Women in Saudi Arabia We become the first consumer goods company to be granted a license to hire women in Saudi Arabia. Since then, our Saudi team has made significant progress in incorporating the talents and insights of women, while still respecting cultural norms and values. 1992 Women in Senior Positions The percentage of women filling senior management positions increases from 5% in 1992 to 30% in 2011. That same year, over 43% of new management hires from the past 5 years are women. 1992 LGBTQ+ Rights P&G includes sexual orientation in its Equal Employment Opportunity statement. The following year we support the creation of an internal grassroots organization known as GABLE and its efforts for LGBTQ+ inclusion within the company. 12341962 Diversity Programming Two years before the U.S. government mandates it, we initiate a diversity program for all employees—providing training and support to grow leaders regardless of sex, race, or religious orientation. 1905 Education Equality James N. Gamble helps establish what becomes the Bethune-Cookman University. This is just the beginning to the company’s long tradition of supporting historically black colleges and universities. 12Sustainable steps to a brighter futureA snapshot of all our sustainability achievements and efforts. OUR FUTURE Ambition 2030 During Earth Week in 2018, we released new sustainability goals for 2030 with one purpose in mind: to make a positive impact on our environment while creating value for our consumers. Learn more about our plan to address finite resources and growing consumption. 2016 World's 1st Beach Plastic Shampoo Bottle Head & Shoulders produces a bottle made from up to 25% recycled beach plastic—the first major step in establishing a unique supply chain involving thousands of volunteers and hundreds of NGOs. 2013 Making Zero Waste a Reality We announce during Earth Week that 45 P&G sites around the world have achieved zero-manufacturing-waste-to-landfill status, leading us to set bigger goals for 2030. 2005 Coldwater Technology 80-85% of energy used in the laundry process is used to heat water. After researchers discover the environmental impact of that, we design Coldwater Technology to deliver optimal performance at lower temperatures. 12342003 Environmentally-Responsible Flushables We lead the development of guidelines for flushable products published by The Water Environment Research Foundation. 1989 A New Life for Plastics We start using recycled plastic in our packaging, but our use of recycled polypropylene (PP) is limited due to a lack of availability of high-quality material. We need a solution, so one of our scientists invent a sustainable technology that recycles a type of plastic that wasn’t recyclable before—helping us reduce even more waste. 1983 Reducing Packaging & Water Use Triple Concentrate Downy makes its debut as one of P&G’s first products to reduce packaging and water use. Over the years, we improve this responsible tech across other products like Dawn, Fairy, Tide, and Ariel. 1956 Establishing the Importance of Safety The first environmental safety publication at P&G is published, providing research on surfactants (like emulsifiers, detergents, and foaming agents) in rivers. This topic continues to be important to P&G as demonstrated by the biological monitoring program at our paper manufacturing plants in 1969 and the release of our first Annual Global Environmental Report in 1993. 1234Take a look at where we are todaySee our BrandsCommunity impactWho we areBrandsWho we areCommunity impactSustainability

Just as we strive to deliver a superior consumer experience, we aim to deliver a superior employee value equation as well. We celebrate the uniqueness of each employee’s journey because we know that loyalty and success stem from the times when people feel inspired to make a difference, have equal opportunity and multiple ways to continue growing, feel pride in making an impact and know they’re being valued and rewarded for their contributions to their team’s and our company’s success. We believe when we support our employees’ wellbeing, they are better able to contribute to the success of the Company and achieve their personal goals.

Citizenship Report 2023 | P&G2023 Citizenship ReportThe information in this report covers the period of July 1, 2022 to June 30, 2023.Delivering For All Our StakeholdersJon R. Moeller Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive OfficerP&G’s objective is to deliver balanced top- and bottom-line growth while serving the needs of all stakeholders – consumers, customers, employees, society and shareowners. We take an integrated approach in every aspect of our Citizenship work. It is not managed centrally or by a separate organization. Each business owns the work and the budget that enables P&G to continue making progress in these important areas. Our efforts in Environmental Sustainability are important in creating value while improving P&G’s environmental impact, enabling consumers to reduce their footprint, and working collaboratively across industries to address some of the most pressing challenges. We start where we have the most control – our operations. We have reduced our Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 58% since 2010, already surpassing our initial 2030 goal of a 50% reduction. We have now set our sights on a 65% reduction by 2030 (versus a 2010 baseline). We are recycling approximately 3.5 billion liters of water a year in our facilities, with a goal of 5 billion liters recycled and reused annually by 2030. We are increasing our use of recycled plastic resin while also decreasing our total use of plastic in packaging – less plastic overall and a higher proportion from recycled sources. Next, we look at how we can enable consumers to reduce their own footprint without making product performance tradeoffs. An example is how Cascade is helping consumers reduce water use. Consumers often believe the dishwasher uses more water than hand washing your dishes, but the opposite can be true – an ENERGY STAR® certified dishwasher uses about four gallons per cycle, while the tap in the sink can use the same amount in about two minutes. So, if you hand wash more than eight dishes, using a dishwasher can save water versus hand washing. Finally, we are helping scale industry-wide solutions to reduce environmental impact. We are deeply engaged with external experts and are sharing our expertise to help solve problems that are too big for any one company to address. In the area of Community Impact, we support people around the world through our brands and products that help restore normalcy in uncertain and challenging times. P&G and our brands work with many local, regional and international partners including Feeding America, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, Matthew 25: Ministries and United Way to provide donations of products and other support to underserved communities and during times of disaster and conflict. With our partners we also provide clean drinking water through the Children’s Safe Drinking Water Program to support people who lack access to clean water. The program is based on an easy-to-use water purification powder invented by P&G scientists that can clean 10 liters of water in just 30 minutes. Since 2004, this program has provided more than 21 billion liters of clean water to people in need around the world. We serve billions of consumers all over the world. Our ability to do this most effectively is enabled by a workforce and culture that understands, respects and reflects the uniqueness of all the consumers we serve – inclusive of all genders, races, ethnicities, sexual orientations, ages and abilities. Equality and inclusion is good for business – broadening market reach and driving market growth. Simply put, it helps us win. Our efforts to attract, develop, and retain the best employees from the broadest pool of talent helps us better serve an increasingly diverse set of consumers. Our equality and inclusion efforts, inside our Company and in our communities, are critical for our long-term success and are helping to drive balanced and sustainable growth. Good governance is the foundation for everything that we do, and P&G is committed both to doing what is right and to being a good corporate citizen. Our corporate governance practices are designed to promote strong board and management accountability, transparency, and protection of shareholder interests. P&G was founded on uncompromising beliefs that our products should be of the highest quality and value, and that the only way to run a business is with honest and fair dealings. These beliefs come to life today in P&G’s Purpose, Values and Principles, which set high standards that we hold ourselves and each other accountable for, creating a strong culture focused on winning the right way. P&G’s employees, leadership team, our board and I are committed to making progress in each of our Citizenship focus areas. We consider it a fundamental part of service – to consumers, customers, employees, society and shareowners. At the end of the day, we serve people – with a strong desire to improve their lives and the lives of their families. We stand by consumers and support them in small but meaningful ways every day – with superior-performing products of high quality at a superior value. We strive to do this in the most responsible way, consistent with P&G’s Values and Principles. This approach, with consumers at the center, and an organization built to serve them, has served us and our many stakeholders well. It will guide our actions as we move forward. If we do this effectively, consumers will benefit, customers will grow their businesses, employees will develop and thrive, we will have a positive impact on society, and shareholders will continue to be rewarded for their investment.

P&G History - A legacy of forward-thinkingP&G History.A legacy of forward-thinkingFor more than 185 years, we’ve challenged the norm and inspired the future—from the products we put on the shelf to the people we bring on our team. Click a category to explore the events that made us who we are today. Click to jump to each section. Serendipitous momentsSocial effortsInnovative productsRevolutionary techEveryday practicesPutting people firstSustainable effortsMoments of brillianceSerendipitous strokes of genius and passion-fueled ideas launched iconic brands and defined us as a company. OUR FUTURE Open Call for Ideas Our Connect + Develop program helps us partner with innovators around the world to solve problems for our consumers’ needs. Learn more. 2000 A Food Wrap That Whitens Teeth: Glad Press’n Seal & Crest Whitestrips To combat plastic wrap that loses its grip, P&G develops a technology to create Glad Press’n Seal. At the same time, a young employee working on at-home teeth whitening products connects with his mentor who shares a prototype of the food wrap with him. Sparked by this new idea, they cut the wrap into small strips, and apply it to their teeth. Shortly after, Crest Whitestrips is developed. 1998 One Insight That Led to Easier Cleaning for All: Always & Swiffer Wet Jet A consumer explained to a Products Researcher that while she liked Mr. Clean liquid, it didn’t make the cleaning process any easier. She opened her broom closet—full of mops, brushes, and buckets—and asked him to clean that up. Our researchers combine our capabilities in highly absorbent non-wovens, like the ones used in Always and Pampers, with our cleaner solutions expertise, creating both the Swiffer Wet Jet and the Quick Clean category. 1973 A Softener for the Dryer: Bounce With the addition of dryers in homes, static cling becomes a key issue. P&G finds a new way to deliver fabric softener via a towel. Research quickly led us to an inventor who had already figured it out, and we acquired the technology. Bounce dryer sheets are introduced as a fresh alternative to liquid fabric softeners. 12341961 A Grandfather Inspired by His Grandson: Pampers While watching his first grandchild, a P&G researcher quickly realizes the mess of cloth diapers and the need to carry them until returning home. This leads him and fellow researchers to develop a better & more affordable disposable diaper. Since then, Pampers has continuously advanced—moving from pins to tapes, becoming thinner and more cloth-like, and designed for babies at every stage of development. 1894 A Father's Concern: VapoRub A pharmacist developed several home remedies, such as cough syrups and other liquids that he sold in his local store. One day his infant son became ill. Unsure any of the ingestible products would be effective, he creates an externally-applied salve that releases cough-soothing vapors when heated by the body. His son’s health improves, and generations around the world grow up with VapoRub. 12A corporate force for goodOur employees have been the driving force behind our support for our environment, communities, and people—a practice that has been ingrained in our culture for over a century. OUR FUTURE Building Our Impact Each year, we actively continue to integrate Citizenship into how we do business. The more we do that, the bigger the impact we can make with the people we serve, the communities where we live and work, and the broader world that surrounds us. See what we’re up to now. 2015 Always’ #LikeAGirl The 2015 Super Bowl’s most-liked commercial changes the conversation about girls and sports, taking an unintentionally derogatory phrase and making it one of empowerment, strength, and pride. Millions of girls around the world rally to change #LikeAGirl to mean amazing things. This massive engagement starts to change public perception: while only 19% of girls had a positive association with the phrase “like a girl” before the campaign, 76% agree they no longer view the phrase as an insult after watching the Always #LikeAGirl film. 2012 Summer Olympics Campaign After the success of our 2010 “Proud Sponsor of Moms” campaign, we launch “Thank You, Mom"—a campaign where we support 150 global athletes and their Moms. When asked in what way we can help them most, Moms respond that they'd like to see us support youth sports. For this reason, we commit to raising $25 million globally. 2012 Honored in the Community The United Way—a non-profit organization that fights for health, education, and financial stability—celebrates its 125th Anniversary and awards us with The Spirit of America Award, their highest national honor for any corporation. We have always placed an emphasis on supporting the communities where we’re located, starting with Cincinnati’s first coordinated community charity in 1915 following devastating floods in the region. 12342005 Tide Loads of Hope The program is launched to help families hit by natural disaster by washing, drying, and folding laundry for them. By 2012, we cleaned more than 34,000 loads of laundry for families affected by disasters, including Hurricane Katrina, the San Diego wildfires, Hurricane Ike and more. In 2017 alone, the Tide Loads of Hope program washes 3,100 loads of laundry. 2004 Children's Safe Drinking Water An employee looks into cleaning water so moms in an African village could do laundry easier. As his team works on a way to reuse the wash water, they leverage P&G laundry technology and soon realize they could get it so clean you could drink it. So instead of laundry, they bring families clean drinking water—a much more important need. 1978 Dawn Wildlife Rescue International Bird Rescue begins testing all major dish soaps for cleaning and discovers that Dawn works the best. It’s the only product strong enough to remove the oil, yet gentle enough to not harm the integrity of the feathers. Since then, P&G has donated over 50,000 bottles and helped more than 75,000 animals. 123Products that broke the moldP&G history is full of never-before-seen innovations that solved problems and inspired the industry to catch up. OUR FUTURE Inventing the Products We Need Partnering with experts & innovators inside and outside our walls, we’re identifying what consumer needs aren’t being met, and developing tech to solve them. Check out what we’re working on now. 2001 The First Razor Designed Specifically for Women For the first time, Gillette asks women about their shaving experience, not just their shaving needs. Venus is developed after recognizing the key differences between men’s and women’s shaving. Using our best blades, Venus incorporates rounded cartridges, anti-bacterial rubber, and in-shower ergonomics and packaging. 1961 Dandruff, Solved Consumers were dissatisfied with existing anti-dandruff shampoos. After 10 years of research, our scientists discovered Pyrithione Zinc, an ingredient that reduces dandruff. We introduce it as Head & Shoulders in 1961 and it quickly becomes one of P&G’s biggest brands. In 1988, we launch is as our first brand in China. 1955 Preventing Tooth Decay Our researchers collaborate with Indiana University to develop the first stable fluoride toothpaste. Crest is introduced and becomes the first toothpaste with fluoride clinically proven to fight cavities and help prevent tooth decay—the second-most prevalent disease at the time. We also start reaching out to dentists, enlisting them to help prevent oral care issues rather than just repairing them—dramatically changing the way people think about taking care of their teeth. In 1960, the American Dental Association recognizes Crest as effective against cavities, catapulting the brands credibility. 12341949 The Soft Toothbrush A California dentist invents Oral-B toothbrushes using soft nylon bristles, out of concern for his patients gums. As a small entrepreneur, he sells them only to his dentist friends who in turn recommend the brand to their patients. Oral-B will grow to become one of the largest global brush brands. 1946 Tide, The Washday Miracle In 1933, Dreft is introduced as the first-ever household synthetic detergent, but research continues to develop a product that can clean consumer’s toughest stains. After almost a decade of failed work, the project is ordered to stop. But for 7 years, the lead researcher secretly works on the product in his spare time. By 1946, he has created a game changing product which is introduced as Tide. Called “The Washday Miracle”, it cleans better than anything on the market. 1879 The Soap That Floats James N. Gamble, son of the founder, recognizes that families must have 2 different bars of soap—one for laundry and one for bathing. He creates an innovative single bar of soap that works for both purposes. Named Ivory Soap, it takes the country by storm as one of the company’s most legendary brands. 123Tech that revolutionized the industryIf there’s one thing we know, it’s that there’s always a smarter, more efficient, simply better way of doing things. This principle has led to P&G products that have changed the way categories think. OUR FUTURE Keeping the Gears Moving We’re constantly working to propel the industry into the future whether it’s with product and packaging innovations, coming up with creative ways to use data, or finding ways to reinvent our business model. 2012 Tide Pods Designed as a detergent + stain remover + brightener in one, Tide Pods breaks through the laundry category. The pods deliver a new formula in a small dose that is HE compatible and twice as compacted as the current 2x Tide Liquid. 1998 Changing the Aircare Category One the biggest unmet consumer needs is finding a way to clean things that can’t go into the washing machine. With that problem in mind Procter & Gamble invents Febreze, a product that doesn’t just cover up bad scent, but actually removes it. 1986 Invention of 2-in-1 Our researchers set out to perfect a formula that cleans, lathers, rinses, and conditions in one convenient step. After more than three years of work, we launch the first “2-in-1” shampoo and conditioner on the market and expand that technology to Head & Shoulders, Pantene, and Vidal Sassoon. 12341965 A New Way to Make Paper Recognizing that people could only buy paper that was either soft or strong, Charmin creates a new way to allow for both in the same tissue, calling it CPF. With this new technology comes the famous ad campaign, “Please don’t squeeze the Charmin”. 1901 Improving the Razor King C. Gillette patents the KC Gillette Razor, an alternative to the straight razor. A breakthrough in the category, its permanent handle and disposable blade provides men with a safe and convenient way to shave. 12Practices that improve people's livesProviding customers with quality products that make every day better has driven our purpose for over 180 years. OUR FUTURE Ingredient Transparency We’re committed to continuing to be transparent about the ingredients we use (and don’t use) so that you can be confident when you add P&G products to your cart. See our fragrance ingredients list here. 2007 P&G in Your Neighborhood Tide Dry Cleaners launches in 2008 and is P&G’s big move into the service industry. It is quickly franchised across the country and in the first two years, serves over 500,000 customers, processes over 3.4 million garments, and creates over 150 jobs. 1941 Talking to Consumers We become one of the first companies to formally respond to consumer correspondence. By 1974, toll-free phone numbers allow consumers to contact us directly. By the 1990s, we incorporate email, and by the 2000s, social media makes connecting with consumers easier than ever. In 2011, we invent a listening solution which lets brands monitor what people are saying about their products in real-time. 1924 Start of Market Research D. Paul "Doc" Smelser, a Ph.D. economist from Johns Hopkins University, joins the team. He collects statistical data breaking out consumers by income and background, making us the first company to conduct deliberate, data-based market research with consumers. This allows us to improve consumer understanding and anticipate their needs to create products that improve everyday life. 12341890 First R&D Lab R&D quickly becomes a critical function at P&G and our first lab is added to the Ivorydale facility. By the 1920s, R&D is an integrated division of our company, employing a staff of several hundred young men and women. The Research Department develops ways to improve products, then passes their findings on to be translated into new manufacturing processes. 1887 Honest Business Ethics P&G products, known for their reputation for quality and being made by a company built on ethics, begin to be recognized through the slogan “Highest Grade, Honest Weight”. A retailer in Chicago, Illinois carries nothing but P&G products due to the demand for trusted products. 1886 An Industrial Masterpiece After a disastrous fire at our first plant, Ivorydale is purposefully built as a modern manufacturing facility. Designed by one of the nation's foremost industrial architects, Solon Beman, the new plant incorporates the latest designs for the safety and comfort of employees. We spend the next 130+ years expanding these manufacturing principles across the globe. 123A company that puts people firstWhat allows us to be one of the largest consumer goods company in the world is filling our buildings with passionate, inspired, motivated people who believe in doing better than good, every day. OUR FUTURE Diversity in Everything We Do We believe in diversity & inclusion. That’s why we support it however we can—from creating flexible work schedules for our employees to building inclusive playgrounds for children with and without disabilities. Learn more about our efforts. 2005 Women in Saudi Arabia We become the first consumer goods company to be granted a license to hire women in Saudi Arabia. Since then, our Saudi team has made significant progress in incorporating the talents and insights of women, while still respecting cultural norms and values. 1992 Women in Senior Positions The percentage of women filling senior management positions increases from 5% in 1992 to 30% in 2011. That same year, over 43% of new management hires from the past 5 years are women. 1992 LGBTQ+ Rights P&G includes sexual orientation in its Equal Employment Opportunity statement. The following year we support the creation of an internal grassroots organization known as GABLE and its efforts for LGBTQ+ inclusion within the company. 12341962 Diversity Programming Two years before the U.S. government mandates it, we initiate a diversity program for all employees—providing training and support to grow leaders regardless of sex, race, or religious orientation. 1905 Education Equality James N. Gamble helps establish what becomes the Bethune-Cookman University. This is just the beginning to the company’s long tradition of supporting historically black colleges and universities. 12Sustainable steps to a brighter futureA snapshot of all our sustainability achievements and efforts. OUR FUTURE Ambition 2030 During Earth Week in 2018, we released new sustainability goals for 2030 with one purpose in mind: to make a positive impact on our environment while creating value for our consumers. Learn more about our plan to address finite resources and growing consumption. 2016 World's 1st Beach Plastic Shampoo Bottle Head & Shoulders produces a bottle made from up to 25% recycled beach plastic—the first major step in establishing a unique supply chain involving thousands of volunteers and hundreds of NGOs. 2013 Making Zero Waste a Reality We announce during Earth Week that 45 P&G sites around the world have achieved zero-manufacturing-waste-to-landfill status, leading us to set bigger goals for 2030. 2005 Coldwater Technology 80-85% of energy used in the laundry process is used to heat water. After researchers discover the environmental impact of that, we design Coldwater Technology to deliver optimal performance at lower temperatures. 12342003 Environmentally-Responsible Flushables We lead the development of guidelines for flushable products published by The Water Environment Research Foundation. 1989 A New Life for Plastics We start using recycled plastic in our packaging, but our use of recycled polypropylene (PP) is limited due to a lack of availability of high-quality material. We need a solution, so one of our scientists invent a sustainable technology that recycles a type of plastic that wasn’t recyclable before—helping us reduce even more waste. 1983 Reducing Packaging & Water Use Triple Concentrate Downy makes its debut as one of P&G’s first products to reduce packaging and water use. Over the years, we improve this responsible tech across other products like Dawn, Fairy, Tide, and Ariel. 1956 Establishing the Importance of Safety The first environmental safety publication at P&G is published, providing research on surfactants (like emulsifiers, detergents, and foaming agents) in rivers. This topic continues to be important to P&G as demonstrated by the biological monitoring program at our paper manufacturing plants in 1969 and the release of our first Annual Global Environmental Report in 1993. 1234Take a look at where we are todaySee our BrandsCommunity impactWho we areBrandsWho we areCommunity impactSustainability

In no event shall any adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting of shareholders, or the announcement thereof, commence a new time period for the giving of Timely Notice as described above. (c) Business Properly Brought Before a Special Meeting of Shareholders. At a special meeting of shareholders, only such business will be conducted or considered as is properly brought before the meeting.

Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors may not be made at a special meeting of shareholders unless directors are to be elected pursuant to the Company’s notice of meeting. In such case, any shareholder of the Company who (A) was a shareholder of record (and, with respect to any beneficial owner, if different, on whose behalf such business is proposed, only if such beneficial owner was the beneficial owner of shares of the Company) both at the time of giving the notice provided for in this Section 8 and at the time of the meeting, (B) is entitled to vote at the meeting, and (C) has complied with this Section 8 as to such nomination, may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be), for election to such position(s) as specified in the Company’s notice of meeting. (d) Requirement of Timely Notice of Shareholder Nominations for Special Meeting of the Shareholders Held for the Purpose of Electing One or More Directors. In the event the Company calls a special meeting of shareholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board of Directors, any shareholder meeting the criteria in Section 8(c) above may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be), for election to such position(s) as specified in the Company’s notice of meeting, if the shareholder’s notice with respect to any nomination shall be delivered to the Secretary of the Company not earlier than the close of business on the two hundred and fortieth (240th) day prior to such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the one hundred and fortieth (140th) day prior to such special meeting or the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting. In no event shall any adjournment of a special meeting or the announcement thereof commence a new time period for the giving of a shareholder’s notice as described above. (e) Requirements for Proper Form of Shareholder Notice. To be in proper form for purposes of this Section 8, a shareholder’s notice to the Secretary of the Company must: (i) set forth, as to the shareholder giving the notice and each Shareholder Associated Person (A) the name and address of such shareholder, as they appear on the Company’s books, and the name and address of each Shareholder Associated Person, (B) the class and number of shares of the Company which are, directly or indirectly, held of record or beneficially owned (within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) by such shareholder and any Shareholder Associated Person as of the date of the notice, and a representation that the shareholder and any Shareholder Associated Person will notify the Company in writing within five business days after the record date for such meeting of the class and number of shares of the Company held of record on such record date, (C) any other information relating to such shareholder and any Shareholder Associated Person that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies for, as applicable, the proposal and/or for the election of directors in a contested election pursuant to Section 14 of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and (D) such shareholder’s and any Shareholder Associated Person’s written consent to the public disclosure of information provided to the Company pursuant to this Section 8; (ii) set forth, as to the shareholder giving the notice and any Shareholder Associated Person (A) any agreements, arrangements or understandings entered into by the shareholder or Shareholder Associated Person, as appropriate, with respect to equity securities of the Company, including any put or call arrangements, derivative securities, short positions, borrowed shares or swap or similar arrangements, specifying in each case the effect of such agreements, arrangements or understandings on any voting or economic rights of equity securities of the Company, in each case as of the date of the notice and in each case describing any changes in voting or economic rights which may arise pursuant to the terms of such agreements, arrangements or understandings, (B) to the extent not covered in clause (A) above, any disclosures that would be required pursuant to Item 5 or Item 6 of Schedule 13D (regardless of whether the requirement to file a Schedule 13D is applicable to the shareholder or beneficial owner), and (C) a representation that the shareholder will notify the Company in writing within five business days after the record date for such meeting of the information set forth in clause (A) and (B) above as of such record date; (iii) if the notice relates to any business other than a nomination of a director or directors that the shareholder proposes to bring before the meeting, set forth (A) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such business of such shareholder and any Shareholder Associated Person and (B) a description of all agreements, arrangements and understandings between such shareholder and any Shareholder Associated Person, and any other person or persons (including their names) in connection with the proposal of such business by such shareholder; (iv) set forth, as to each person, if any, whom the shareholder proposes to nominate for election or reelection to the Board of Directors (A) all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies for election of directors in a contested election pursuant to Section 14 of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (including such person’s written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected) and (B) a description of all direct and indirect compensation and other material monetary agreements, arrangements and understandings during the past three years, and any other material relationships, between or among such shareholder and any Shareholder Associated Person, on the one hand, and each proposed nominee, and his or her respective affiliates and associates, or others acting in concert therewith, on the other hand, including without limitation all information that would be required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404 promulgated under Regulation S-K if the shareholder making the nomination and any Shareholder Associated Person were the “registrant” for purposes of such rule and the nominee were a director or executive officer of such registrant; (v) set forth a representation that such shareholder intends to appear at the annual meeting to bring such nomination or other business before the annual meeting; (vi) if the notice relates to a nomination of a director or directors, set forth a representation that the shareholder and each Shareholder Associated Person, if any, intend or are part of a group that intends to solicit proxies or votes in support of each person whom the shareholder proposes to nominate for election or reelection to the Board of Directors in accordance with Rule 14a-19 under the Exchange Act; (vii) set forth such other information as may reasonably be required by the Board of Directors as described in the Company’s proxy statement for the preceding year’s annual meeting; and (viii) be followed, within five business days after the record date for such meeting, by the written notice providing the information described in clauses (i) and (ii) above. “Shareholder Associated Person” of any shareholder means (i) any affiliate or associate (as such terms are defined for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) of the shareholder and any other person acting in concert with them, (ii) any beneficial owner of shares of stock of the Company owned of record or beneficially by such shareholders, and (iii) any person controlling, controlled by, or under common control with such person. The Company may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as may reasonably be required by the Company to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as an independent director of the Company or that could be material to a reasonable shareholder’s understanding of the independence, or lack thereof, of such nominee. (f) Determination of Business Not Properly Brought Before a Meeting. Only such persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 8 or Section 9 of this Article I shall be eligible to serve as directors and only such business shall be conducted at a meeting of shareholders as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 8 or Section 9 of this Article I. Except as otherwise provided by law, the Articles of Incorporation of the Company or these Regulations, the determination of whether any business sought to be brought before any annual or special meeting of the shareholders is properly brought before such meeting in accordance with this Section 8 or Section 9 of this Article I will be made by the presiding officer of such meeting. If the presiding officer determines that any business is not properly brought before such meeting, he or she will so declare to the meeting and any such business will not be conducted or considered. (g) Rule 14a-8; Exchange Act Compliance. This Section 8 is expressly intended to apply to any business proposed to be brought before an annual meeting of shareholders other than any shareholder proposal made pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 8, a shareholder must also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act with respect to the matters set forth in this Section 8. Nothing in this Section 8 will be deemed to affect any rights of shareholders to request inclusion of proposals in the Company’s proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act. (h) Rule 14a-19. Unless otherwise required by law, if any shareholder (i)(A) provides notice pursuant to Rule 14a-19(b) under the Exchange Act and (B) subsequently fails to comply with the requirements of Rule 14a-19(a)(2) or Rule 14a-19(a)(3) under the Exchange Act or (ii) notifies the Company that such shareholder no longer intends to solicit proxies in accordance with Rule 14a-19 under the Exchange Act, then the Company shall disregard any proxies or votes solicited for such shareholder’s director nominees. Upon request by the Company, if any shareholder provides notice pursuant to Rule 14a-19(b), such shareholder shall deliver to the Company reasonable evidence that it has met the requirements of Rule 14a-19(a)(3), and such evidence shall be received by the Secretary of the Company at the principal executive offices of the Company not later than five business days prior to the date of the meeting of shareholders. (i) Definition of Public Announcement. For purposes of this Section 8 and Section 9 of this Article 1, “public announcement” means disclosure in a press release reported by a national news service or in a document publicly filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Sections 13, 14, or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. SECTION 9. Proxy Access for Director Nominations. The Company shall include in its proxy statement for an annual shareholder meeting the name, together with the Required Information (as defined below), of any person nominated for election (a “Shareholder Nominee”) to the Board of Directors by a shareholder that satisfies, or by a group of no more than twenty (20) shareholders that satisfy, the requirements of this Section 9 (an “Eligible Shareholder”), and that expressly elects at the time of providing the notice required by this Section 9 (the “Nomination Notice”) to have its nominee included in the Company’s proxy materials pursuant to this Section 9. (a) Delivery of Nomination Notice. A shareholder’s Nomination Notice, together with the Required Information, must be delivered to the Secretary of the Company not less than one hundred and twenty (120) days and not more than one hundred and fifty (150) days prior to the one year anniversary of the preceding year’s annual shareholder meeting; provided, however, that if the date of the annual shareholder meeting is more than thirty (30) days before or more than sixty (60) days after such anniversary date, the Nomination Notice must be so delivered not later than the one hundred and twentieth (120th) day prior to such annual shareholder meeting, or, if later, the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such annual shareholder meeting was first made. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual shareholder meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a Nomination Notice as described above. (b) Required Information. For purposes of this Section 9, the “Required Information” that the Company will include in its proxy statement is (i) the information concerning the Shareholder Nominee and the Eligible Shareholder that, as determined by the Board of Directors, is required to be disclosed in the Company’s proxy statement filed pursuant to the proxy rules of the SEC; and (ii) if the Eligible Shareholder so elects, a written statement not to exceed five hundred (500) words, in support of the Shareholder Nominee’s candidacy (the “Statement”), which must be provided at the same time as the Nomination Notice. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 9, the Company may omit from its proxy materials any information or Statement (or portion thereof) that (A) directly or indirectly impugns the character, integrity or personal reputation of, or directly or indirectly makes charges concerning improper, illegal or immoral conduct or associations, without factual foundation, with respect to any person; or (B) would violate any applicable law or regulation. Nothing in this Section 9 shall limit the ability of the Company to solicit proxies against the Shareholder Nominee or to include in its own proxy materials the Company’s own statements or any other additional information relating to any Eligible Shareholder or Shareholder Nominee. (c) Shareholder Nominees. (i) The number of Shareholder Nominees appearing in the Company’s proxy materials with respect to an annual shareholder meeting shall not exceed the greater of (A) two (2) or twenty percent (20%) of the number of directors in office as of the last day on which a Nomination Notice may be delivered pursuant to this Section 9, or if such amount is not a whole number, the closest whole number below twenty percent (20%); provided, however, that this maximum number shall be reduced, but not below zero (0), by the number of (I) Shareholder Nominees that were submitted by an Eligible Shareholder for inclusion in the Company’s proxy materials pursuant to this Section 9 but either are subsequently withdrawn or that the Board of Directors decides to nominate as Board nominees, and (II) director candidates for which the Company shall have received one or more valid shareholder notices (whether or not subsequently withdrawn) nominating director candidates pursuant to Section 8. In the event that one or more vacancies for any reason occurs on the Board of Directors after the last day on which a Nomination Notice can be delivered pursuant to this Section 9 but before the date of the annual shareholder meeting and the Board of Directors resolves to reduce the size of the Board of Directors in connection therewith, the maximum number of Shareholder Nominees included in the Company’s proxy materials shall be calculated based on the number of directors as so reduced. (ii) In the event that the number of Shareholder Nominees submitted by Eligible Shareholders pursuant to this Section 9 exceeds this maximum number, each Eligible Shareholder will select one Shareholder Nominee for inclusion in the Company’s proxy materials until the maximum number is reached, going in order of the amount (largest to smallest) of shares of the capital stock of the Company each Eligible Shareholder disclosed as owned in its respective Nomination Notice submitted to the Company. If the maximum number is not reached after each Eligible Shareholder has selected one Shareholder Nominee, this selection process will continue as many times as necessary, following the same order each time, until the maximum number is reached. (iii) Following the determination of which Shareholder Nominees shall be included in the Company’s proxy materials, if any Shareholder Nominee who satisfies the eligibility requirements herein is thereafter: nominated by the Board of Directors; is otherwise not included in the Company’s proxy materials; or is not submitted for director election for any reason (including the Eligible Shareholder’s or Shareholder Nominee’s failure to comply with the requirements herein), no other nominee or nominees shall be included in the Company’s proxy materials or otherwise submitted for director election in substitution thereof. (iv) The Company shall not be required to include, pursuant to this Section 9, any Shareholder Nominee in its proxy materials for any meeting of shareholders (A) if the Eligible Shareholder who has nominated such Shareholder Nominee has engaged in or is currently engaged in, or has been or is a “participant” in another person’s, “solicitation” within the meaning of Rule 14a-1(l) under the 1934 Act in support of the election of any individual as a director at the meeting other than its Shareholder Nominee(s) or a nominee of the Board of Directors, (B) who is not independent under the Applicable Independence Standards (as defined below), as determined by the Board of Directors, (C) who serves as an executive officer of a company where a P&G employee director serves on the Board of Directors, (D) whose election as a member of the Board of Directors would cause the Company to be in violation of these Regulations, the Articles of Incorporation, the listing standards of the principal exchange upon which the Company’s capital stock is traded, or any applicable law, rule or regulation, (E) who is or has been, within the past three years, an officer or director of a competitor, as defined in Section 8 of the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914, (F) who is a named subject of a pending criminal proceeding (excluding minor traffic violations and other minor offenses) or has been convicted in such a criminal proceeding within the past ten (10) years, (G) who is subject to any order of the type specified in Rule 506(d) of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (H) if such Shareholder Nominee or the applicable Eligible Shareholder shall have provided information to the Company in respect to such nomination that was untrue in any material respect or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statement made, in light of the circumstances under which it was made, not misleading, as determined by the Board of Directors, or (I) if the Eligible Shareholder or applicable Shareholder Nominee otherwise contravenes any of the agreements or representations made by such Eligible Shareholder or Shareholder Nominee or fails to comply with its obligations pursuant to this Section 9. (v) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Board of Directors or the person presiding at the meeting shall declare a nomination by an Eligible Shareholder to be invalid, and such nomination shall be disregarded notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the Company, if (A) the Shareholder Nominee(s) and/or the applicable Eligible Shareholder shall have breached its or their obligations, agreements or representations under this Section 9, as determined by the Board of Directors or the person presiding at the annual shareholder meeting, or (B) the Eligible Shareholder (or a qualified representative thereof) does not appear at the annual shareholder meeting to present any nomination pursuant to this Section 9. For purposes of this Section 9, to be considered a qualified representative of the Eligible Shareholder, a person must be authorized by a writing executed by such Eligible Shareholder, or an electronic transmission delivered by such Eligible Shareholder, to act for such Eligible Shareholder as proxy at the annual shareholder meeting and such person must produce such writing or electronic transmission, or a reliable reproduction of the writing or electronic transmission, at the annual shareholder meeting. (d) Ownership Requirements. (i) An Eligible Shareholder must have owned (as defined above) 3% or more of the Company’s outstanding capital stock continuously for at least three (3) years (the “Required Shares”) as of both (A) a date within seven (7) days prior to the date of the Nomination Notice and (B) the record date for determining shareholders entitled to vote at the annual shareholder meeting. The Eligible Shareholder must continue to own the Required Shares through the annual shareholder meeting date. For purposes of satisfying the foregoing ownership requirement under this Section 9, (I) the shares of the capital stock of the Company owned by one or more shareholders, or by the person or persons who own shares of the capital stock of the Company and on whose behalf any shareholder is acting, may be aggregated, provided that the number of shareholders and other persons whose ownership of shares is aggregated for such purpose shall not exceed twenty (20), and (II) a group of funds under common management and investment control shall be treated as one shareholder or person for this purpose. No person may be a member of more than one group of persons constituting an Eligible Shareholder under this Section 9. (ii) For purposes of this Section 9, an Eligible Shareholder shall be deemed to “own” only those outstanding shares as to which the shareholder possesses both (A) the full voting and investment rights pertaining to the shares and (B) the full economic interest in (including the opportunity for profit and risk of loss on) such shares; provided that the number of shares calculated in accordance with clauses (A) and (B) shall not include any shares (I) sold by such shareholder or any of its affiliates in any transaction that has not been settled or closed, including any short sale, (II) borrowed by such shareholder or any of its affiliates for any purposes or purchased by such shareholder or any of its affiliates pursuant to an agreement to resell, or (III) subject to any option, warrant, forward contract, swap, contract of sale, or other derivative or similar agreement entered into by such shareholder or any of its affiliates, whether any such instrument or agreement is to be settled with shares or with cash based on the notional amount or value of shares, in any such case which instrument or agreement has, or is intended to have, the purpose or effect of (a) reducing in any manner, to any extent or at any time in the future, such shareholder’s or its affiliates’ full right to vote or direct the voting of any such shares, and/or (b) hedging, offsetting or altering to any degree gain or loss arising from the full economic ownership of such shares by such shareholder or affiliate. A shareholder shall “own” shares held in the name of a nominee or other intermediary so long as the shareholder retains the right to instruct how the shares are voted with respect to the election of directors and possesses the full economic interest in the shares. A person’s ownership of shares shall be deemed to continue during any period in which (A) the person has loaned such shares, provided that the person has the power to recall such loaned shares on three (3) business days’ notice; or (B) the person has delegated any voting power by means of a proxy, power of attorney or other instrument or arrangement that is revocable at any time by the person. The terms “owned,” “owning” and other variations of the word “own” shall have correlative meanings. Whether outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Company are “owned” for these purposes shall be determined by the Board of Directors, which determination shall be conclusive and binding on the Company and its shareholders. (e) Agreements of the Eligible Shareholder. An Eligible Shareholder shall: (i) Within the time period specified in this Section 9 for providing the Nomination Notice, provide the following information in writing to the Secretary of the Company: (A) one or more written statements from the record holder of the shares (and from each intermediary through which the shares are or have been held during the requisite three-year holding period) verifying that, as of a date within seven (7) days prior to the date of the Nomination Notice, the Eligible Shareholder owns, and has owned continuously for the preceding three (3) years, the Required Shares, and the Eligible Shareholder’s agreement to provide, within five (5) business days after the record date for the annual shareholder meeting, written statements from the record holder and intermediaries verifying the Eligible Shareholder’s continuous ownership of the Required Shares through the record date; (B) a written statement as to whether or not the Eligible Shareholder intends to maintain ownership of the Required Shares for at least one year following the annual shareholder meeting; (C) the written consent of each Shareholder Nominee to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected, together with the information and representations that would be required to be set forth in a shareholder’s notice of a nomination pursuant to Section 8 of this Article I; (D) a copy of the Schedule 14N that has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as required by Rule 14a-18 under the 1934 Act, as such rule may be amended; (E) a representation and warranty that the Eligible Shareholder (including each member of any group of shareholders that together is an Eligible Shareholder under this Section 9) (I) acquired the Required Shares in the ordinary course of business and not with the intent to change or influence control at the Company, and does not presently have such intent, (II) has not nominated and will not nominate for election to the Board of Directors at the annual shareholder meeting any person other than the Shareholder Nominee(s) being nominated pursuant to this Section 9, (III) has not engaged and will not engage in, and has not and will not be a “participant” in another person’s, “solicitation” within the meaning of Rule 14a-1(l) under the 1934 Act in support of the election of any individual as a director at the annual shareholder meeting other than its Shareholder Nominee or a nominee of the Board of Directors, and (IV) will not distribute to any shareholder any form of proxy for the annual shareholder meeting other than the form distributed by the Company.

(ii) file with the Securities and Exchange Commission any solicitation or other communication with the Company’s shareholders relating to the meeting at which the Shareholder Nominee will be nominated, regardless of whether any such filing is required under Regulation 14A of the 1934 Act or whether any exemption from filing is available for such solicitation or other communication under Regulation 14A of the 1934 Act. (f) Agreements of the Shareholder Nominee. (i) Within the time period specified in this Section 9 for providing the Nomination Notice, a Shareholder Nominee must deliver to the Secretary of the Company a written representation and agreement that the Shareholder Nominee (A) is not and will not become a party to (I) any agreement, arrangement or understanding with, and has not given any commitment or assurance to, any person or entity as to how such person, if elected as a director of the Company, will act or vote on any issue or question that has not been disclosed to the Company (a “Voting Commitment”), or (II) any Voting Commitment that could limit or interfere with the Shareholder Nominee’s ability to comply, if elected as a director of the Company, with the Shareholder Nominee’s fiduciary duties under applicable law, (B) is not and will not become a party to any agreement, arrangement or understanding with any person or entity other than the Company with respect to any direct or indirect compensation, reimbursement or indemnification in connection with service or action as a Shareholder Nominee that has not been disclosed to the Company, and is not and will not become a party to any agreement, arrangement, or understanding with any person or entity other than the Company with respect to any direct or indirect compensation, reimbursement, or indemnification in connection with service or action as a director, if elected, and (C) will comply with all the Company’s corporate governance, conflict of interest, confidentiality and stock ownership and trading policies and guidelines, and any other Company policies and guidelines applicable to directors, as well as any applicable law, rule or regulation or listing requirement. (ii) At the request of the Company, the Shareholder Nominee must submit all completed and signed questionnaires required of the Company’s directors and officers. The Company may request such additional information as necessary to permit the Board of Directors to determine if each Shareholder Nominee is independent under the listing standards of the principal U.S. exchange upon which the Company’s capital stock is listed, any applicable rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and any publicly disclosed standards used by the Board of Directors in determining and disclosing the independence of the Company’s directors (the “Applicable Independence Standards”). If the Board of Directors determines that the Shareholder Nominee is not independent under the Applicable Independence Standards, the Shareholder Nominee will not be eligible for inclusion in the Company’s proxy materials. (g) Authority of the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors (and any other person or body authorized by the Board of Directors) shall have the power and authority to interpret this Section 9 and to make any and all determinations necessary or advisable to apply this Section 9 to any persons, facts or circumstances, including the power to determine (i) whether a person or group of persons qualifies as an Eligible Shareholder; (ii) whether outstanding shares of the Company’s capital stock are “owned” for purposes of meeting the ownership requirements of this Section 9; (iii) whether any and all requirements of this Section 9 have been satisfied, including a Nomination Notice; (iv) whether a person satisfies the qualifications and requirements to be a Shareholder Nominee, including any publicly disclosed standards used by the Board of Directors in determining the qualifications of nominees; and (v) whether inclusion of the Required Information in the Company’s proxy statement is consistent with all applicable laws, rules, regulations and listing standards. Any such interpretation or determination adopted in good faith by the Board of Directors (or any other person or body authorized by the Board of Directors) shall be conclusive and binding on all persons, including the Company and all record or beneficial owners of stock of the Company. This Section 9 shall be the exclusive means for shareholders to include nominees for election as a director of the Company in the Company’s proxy statement and on its form of proxy for an annual shareholder meeting. For avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this Section 9 shall not apply to a special meeting of shareholders. ARTICLE II BOARD OF DIRECTORS SECTION 1. Number.

Learn more. 2000 A Food Wrap That Whitens Teeth: Glad Press’n Seal & Crest Whitestrips To combat plastic wrap that loses its grip, P&G develops a technology to create Glad Press’n Seal. At the same time, a young employee working on at-home teeth whitening products connects with his mentor who shares a prototype of the food wrap with him. Sparked by this new idea, they cut the wrap into small strips, and apply it to their teeth. Shortly after, Crest Whitestrips is developed. 1998 One Insight That Led to Easier Cleaning for All: Always & Swiffer Wet Jet A consumer explained to a Products Researcher that while she liked Mr. Clean liquid, it didn’t make the cleaning process any easier. She opened her broom closet—full of mops, brushes, and buckets—and asked him to clean that up. Our researchers combine our capabilities in highly absorbent non-wovens, like the ones used in Always and Pampers, with our cleaner solutions expertise, creating both the Swiffer Wet Jet and the Quick Clean category. 1973 A Softener for the Dryer: Bounce With the addition of dryers in homes, static cling becomes a key issue. P&G finds a new way to deliver fabric softener via a towel. Research quickly led us to an inventor who had already figured it out, and we acquired the technology. Bounce dryer sheets are introduced as a fresh alternative to liquid fabric softeners. 12341961 A Grandfather Inspired by His Grandson: Pampers While watching his first grandchild, a P&G researcher quickly realizes the mess of cloth diapers and the need to carry them until returning home. This leads him and fellow researchers to develop a better & more affordable disposable diaper. Since then, Pampers has continuously advanced—moving from pins to tapes, becoming thinner and more cloth-like, and designed for babies at every stage of development. 1894 A Father's Concern: VapoRub A pharmacist developed several home remedies, such as cough syrups and other liquids that he sold in his local store. One day his infant son became ill. Unsure any of the ingestible products would be effective, he creates an externally-applied salve that releases cough-soothing vapors when heated by the body. His son’s health improves, and generations around the world grow up with VapoRub. 12A corporate force for goodOur employees have been the driving force behind our support for our environment, communities, and people—a practice that has been ingrained in our culture for over a century. OUR FUTURE Building Our Impact Each year, we actively continue to integrate Citizenship into how we do business. The more we do that, the bigger the impact we can make with the people we serve, the communities where we live and work, and the broader world that surrounds us. See what we’re up to now. 2015 Always’ #LikeAGirl The 2015 Super Bowl’s most-liked commercial changes the conversation about girls and sports, taking an unintentionally derogatory phrase and making it one of empowerment, strength, and pride. Millions of girls around the world rally to change #LikeAGirl to mean amazing things. This massive engagement starts to change public perception: while only 19% of girls had a positive association with the phrase “like a girl” before the campaign, 76% agree they no longer view the phrase as an insult after watching the Always #LikeAGirl film. 2012 Summer Olympics Campaign After the success of our 2010 “Proud Sponsor of Moms” campaign, we launch “Thank You, Mom"—a campaign where we support 150 global athletes and their Moms. When asked in what way we can help them most, Moms respond that they'd like to see us support youth sports. For this reason, we commit to raising $25 million globally. 2012 Honored in the Community The United Way—a non-profit organization that fights for health, education, and financial stability—celebrates its 125th Anniversary and awards us with The Spirit of America Award, their highest national honor for any corporation. We have always placed an emphasis on supporting the communities where we’re located, starting with Cincinnati’s first coordinated community charity in 1915 following devastating floods in the region. 12342005 Tide Loads of Hope The program is launched to help families hit by natural disaster by washing, drying, and folding laundry for them. By 2012, we cleaned more than 34,000 loads of laundry for families affected by disasters, including Hurricane Katrina, the San Diego wildfires, Hurricane Ike and more. In 2017 alone, the Tide Loads of Hope program washes 3,100 loads of laundry. 2004 Children's Safe Drinking Water An employee looks into cleaning water so moms in an African village could do laundry easier. As his team works on a way to reuse the wash water, they leverage P&G laundry technology and soon realize they could get it so clean you could drink it. So instead of laundry, they bring families clean drinking water—a much more important need. 1978 Dawn Wildlife Rescue International Bird Rescue begins testing all major dish soaps for cleaning and discovers that Dawn works the best. It’s the only product strong enough to remove the oil, yet gentle enough to not harm the integrity of the feathers. Since then, P&G has donated over 50,000 bottles and helped more than 75,000 animals. 123Products that broke the moldP&G history is full of never-before-seen innovations that solved problems and inspired the industry to catch up. OUR FUTURE Inventing the Products We Need Partnering with experts & innovators inside and outside our walls, we’re identifying what consumer needs aren’t being met, and developing tech to solve them. Check out what we’re working on now. 2001 The First Razor Designed Specifically for Women For the first time, Gillette asks women about their shaving experience, not just their shaving needs. Venus is developed after recognizing the key differences between men’s and women’s shaving. Using our best blades, Venus incorporates rounded cartridges, anti-bacterial rubber, and in-shower ergonomics and packaging. 1961 Dandruff, Solved Consumers were dissatisfied with existing anti-dandruff shampoos. After 10 years of research, our scientists discovered Pyrithione Zinc, an ingredient that reduces dandruff. We introduce it as Head & Shoulders in 1961 and it quickly becomes one of P&G’s biggest brands. In 1988, we launch is as our first brand in China. 1955 Preventing Tooth Decay Our researchers collaborate with Indiana University to develop the first stable fluoride toothpaste. Crest is introduced and becomes the first toothpaste with fluoride clinically proven to fight cavities and help prevent tooth decay—the second-most prevalent disease at the time. We also start reaching out to dentists, enlisting them to help prevent oral care issues rather than just repairing them—dramatically changing the way people think about taking care of their teeth. In 1960, the American Dental Association recognizes Crest as effective against cavities, catapulting the brands credibility. 12341949 The Soft Toothbrush A California dentist invents Oral-B toothbrushes using soft nylon bristles, out of concern for his patients gums. As a small entrepreneur, he sells them only to his dentist friends who in turn recommend the brand to their patients. Oral-B will grow to become one of the largest global brush brands. 1946 Tide, The Washday Miracle In 1933, Dreft is introduced as the first-ever household synthetic detergent, but research continues to develop a product that can clean consumer’s toughest stains. After almost a decade of failed work, the project is ordered to stop. But for 7 years, the lead researcher secretly works on the product in his spare time. By 1946, he has created a game changing product which is introduced as Tide. Called “The Washday Miracle”, it cleans better than anything on the market. 1879 The Soap That Floats James N. Gamble, son of the founder, recognizes that families must have 2 different bars of soap—one for laundry and one for bathing. He creates an innovative single bar of soap that works for both purposes. Named Ivory Soap, it takes the country by storm as one of the company’s most legendary brands. 123Tech that revolutionized the industryIf there’s one thing we know, it’s that there’s always a smarter, more efficient, simply better way of doing things. This principle has led to P&G products that have changed the way categories think. OUR FUTURE Keeping the Gears Moving We’re constantly working to propel the industry into the future whether it’s with product and packaging innovations, coming up with creative ways to use data, or finding ways to reinvent our business model. 2012 Tide Pods Designed as a detergent + stain remover + brightener in one, Tide Pods breaks through the laundry category. The pods deliver a new formula in a small dose that is HE compatible and twice as compacted as the current 2x Tide Liquid. 1998 Changing the Aircare Category One the biggest unmet consumer needs is finding a way to clean things that can’t go into the washing machine. With that problem in mind Procter & Gamble invents Febreze, a product that doesn’t just cover up bad scent, but actually removes it. 1986 Invention of 2-in-1 Our researchers set out to perfect a formula that cleans, lathers, rinses, and conditions in one convenient step. After more than three years of work, we launch the first “2-in-1” shampoo and conditioner on the market and expand that technology to Head & Shoulders, Pantene, and Vidal Sassoon. 12341965 A New Way to Make Paper Recognizing that people could only buy paper that was either soft or strong, Charmin creates a new way to allow for both in the same tissue, calling it CPF. With this new technology comes the famous ad campaign, “Please don’t squeeze the Charmin”. 1901 Improving the Razor King C. Gillette patents the KC Gillette Razor, an alternative to the straight razor. A breakthrough in the category, its permanent handle and disposable blade provides men with a safe and convenient way to shave. 12Practices that improve people's livesProviding customers with quality products that make every day better has driven our purpose for over 180 years. OUR FUTURE Ingredient Transparency We’re committed to continuing to be transparent about the ingredients we use (and don’t use) so that you can be confident when you add P&G products to your cart. See our fragrance ingredients list here. 2007 P&G in Your Neighborhood Tide Dry Cleaners launches in 2008 and is P&G’s big move into the service industry. It is quickly franchised across the country and in the first two years, serves over 500,000 customers, processes over 3.4 million garments, and creates over 150 jobs. 1941 Talking to Consumers We become one of the first companies to formally respond to consumer correspondence. By 1974, toll-free phone numbers allow consumers to contact us directly. By the 1990s, we incorporate email, and by the 2000s, social media makes connecting with consumers easier than ever. In 2011, we invent a listening solution which lets brands monitor what people are saying about their products in real-time. 1924 Start of Market Research D. Paul "Doc" Smelser, a Ph.D. economist from Johns Hopkins University, joins the team. He collects statistical data breaking out consumers by income and background, making us the first company to conduct deliberate, data-based market research with consumers. This allows us to improve consumer understanding and anticipate their needs to create products that improve everyday life. 12341890 First R&D Lab R&D quickly becomes a critical function at P&G and our first lab is added to the Ivorydale facility. By the 1920s, R&D is an integrated division of our company, employing a staff of several hundred young men and women. The Research Department develops ways to improve products, then passes their findings on to be translated into new manufacturing processes. 1887 Honest Business Ethics P&G products, known for their reputation for quality and being made by a company built on ethics, begin to be recognized through the slogan “Highest Grade, Honest Weight”. A retailer in Chicago, Illinois carries nothing but P&G products due to the demand for trusted products. 1886 An Industrial Masterpiece After a disastrous fire at our first plant, Ivorydale is purposefully built as a modern manufacturing facility. Designed by one of the nation's foremost industrial architects, Solon Beman, the new plant incorporates the latest designs for the safety and comfort of employees. We spend the next 130+ years expanding these manufacturing principles across the globe. 123A company that puts people firstWhat allows us to be one of the largest consumer goods company in the world is filling our buildings with passionate, inspired, motivated people who believe in doing better than good, every day. OUR FUTURE Diversity in Everything We Do We believe in diversity & inclusion. That’s why we support it however we can—from creating flexible work schedules for our employees to building inclusive playgrounds for children with and without disabilities. Learn more about our efforts. 2005 Women in Saudi Arabia We become the first consumer goods company to be granted a license to hire women in Saudi Arabia. Since then, our Saudi team has made significant progress in incorporating the talents and insights of women, while still respecting cultural norms and values. 1992 Women in Senior Positions The percentage of women filling senior management positions increases from 5% in 1992 to 30% in 2011. That same year, over 43% of new management hires from the past 5 years are women. 1992 LGBTQ+ Rights P&G includes sexual orientation in its Equal Employment Opportunity statement. The following year we support the creation of an internal grassroots organization known as GABLE and its efforts for LGBTQ+ inclusion within the company. 12341962 Diversity Programming Two years before the U.S. government mandates it, we initiate a diversity program for all employees—providing training and support to grow leaders regardless of sex, race, or religious orientation. 1905 Education Equality James N. Gamble helps establish what becomes the Bethune-Cookman University. This is just the beginning to the company’s long tradition of supporting historically black colleges and universities. 12Sustainable steps to a brighter futureA snapshot of all our sustainability achievements and efforts. OUR FUTURE Ambition 2030 During Earth Week in 2018, we released new sustainability goals for 2030 with one purpose in mind: to make a positive impact on our environment while creating value for our consumers. Learn more about our plan to address finite resources and growing consumption. 2016 World's 1st Beach Plastic Shampoo Bottle Head & Shoulders produces a bottle made from up to 25% recycled beach plastic—the first major step in establishing a unique supply chain involving thousands of volunteers and hundreds of NGOs. 2013 Making Zero Waste a Reality We announce during Earth Week that 45 P&G sites around the world have achieved zero-manufacturing-waste-to-landfill status, leading us to set bigger goals for 2030. 2005 Coldwater Technology 80-85% of energy used in the laundry process is used to heat water. After researchers discover the environmental impact of that, we design Coldwater Technology to deliver optimal performance at lower temperatures. 12342003 Environmentally-Responsible Flushables We lead the development of guidelines for flushable products published by The Water Environment Research Foundation. 1989 A New Life for Plastics We start using recycled plastic in our packaging, but our use of recycled polypropylene (PP) is limited due to a lack of availability of high-quality material. We need a solution, so one of our scientists invent a sustainable technology that recycles a type of plastic that wasn’t recyclable before—helping us reduce even more waste. 1983 Reducing Packaging & Water Use Triple Concentrate Downy makes its debut as one of P&G’s first products to reduce packaging and water use. Over the years, we improve this responsible tech across other products like Dawn, Fairy, Tide, and Ariel. 1956 Establishing the Importance of Safety The first environmental safety publication at P&G is published, providing research on surfactants (like emulsifiers, detergents, and foaming agents) in rivers. This topic continues to be important to P&G as demonstrated by the biological monitoring program at our paper manufacturing plants in 1969 and the release of our first Annual Global Environmental Report in 1993. 1234Take a look at where we are todaySee our BrandsCommunity impactWho we areBrandsWho we areCommunity impactSustainability

P&G History - A legacy of forward-thinkingP&G History.A legacy of forward-thinkingFor more than 185 years, we’ve challenged the norm and inspired the future—from the products we put on the shelf to the people we bring on our team. Click a category to explore the events that made us who we are today. Click to jump to each section. Serendipitous momentsSocial effortsInnovative productsRevolutionary techEveryday practicesPutting people firstSustainable effortsMoments of brillianceSerendipitous strokes of genius and passion-fueled ideas launched iconic brands and defined us as a company. OUR FUTURE Open Call for Ideas Our Connect + Develop program helps us partner with innovators around the world to solve problems for our consumers’ needs. Learn more. 2000 A Food Wrap That Whitens Teeth: Glad Press’n Seal & Crest Whitestrips To combat plastic wrap that loses its grip, P&G develops a technology to create Glad Press’n Seal. At the same time, a young employee working on at-home teeth whitening products connects with his mentor who shares a prototype of the food wrap with him. Sparked by this new idea, they cut the wrap into small strips, and apply it to their teeth. Shortly after, Crest Whitestrips is developed. 1998 One Insight That Led to Easier Cleaning for All: Always & Swiffer Wet Jet A consumer explained to a Products Researcher that while she liked Mr. Clean liquid, it didn’t make the cleaning process any easier. She opened her broom closet—full of mops, brushes, and buckets—and asked him to clean that up. Our researchers combine our capabilities in highly absorbent non-wovens, like the ones used in Always and Pampers, with our cleaner solutions expertise, creating both the Swiffer Wet Jet and the Quick Clean category. 1973 A Softener for the Dryer: Bounce With the addition of dryers in homes, static cling becomes a key issue. P&G finds a new way to deliver fabric softener via a towel. Research quickly led us to an inventor who had already figured it out, and we acquired the technology. Bounce dryer sheets are introduced as a fresh alternative to liquid fabric softeners. 12341961 A Grandfather Inspired by His Grandson: Pampers While watching his first grandchild, a P&G researcher quickly realizes the mess of cloth diapers and the need to carry them until returning home. This leads him and fellow researchers to develop a better & more affordable disposable diaper. Since then, Pampers has continuously advanced—moving from pins to tapes, becoming thinner and more cloth-like, and designed for babies at every stage of development. 1894 A Father's Concern: VapoRub A pharmacist developed several home remedies, such as cough syrups and other liquids that he sold in his local store. One day his infant son became ill. Unsure any of the ingestible products would be effective, he creates an externally-applied salve that releases cough-soothing vapors when heated by the body. His son’s health improves, and generations around the world grow up with VapoRub. 12A corporate force for goodOur employees have been the driving force behind our support for our environment, communities, and people—a practice that has been ingrained in our culture for over a century. OUR FUTURE Building Our Impact Each year, we actively continue to integrate Citizenship into how we do business. The more we do that, the bigger the impact we can make with the people we serve, the communities where we live and work, and the broader world that surrounds us. See what we’re up to now. 2015 Always’ #LikeAGirl The 2015 Super Bowl’s most-liked commercial changes the conversation about girls and sports, taking an unintentionally derogatory phrase and making it one of empowerment, strength, and pride. Millions of girls around the world rally to change #LikeAGirl to mean amazing things. This massive engagement starts to change public perception: while only 19% of girls had a positive association with the phrase “like a girl” before the campaign, 76% agree they no longer view the phrase as an insult after watching the Always #LikeAGirl film. 2012 Summer Olympics Campaign After the success of our 2010 “Proud Sponsor of Moms” campaign, we launch “Thank You, Mom"—a campaign where we support 150 global athletes and their Moms. When asked in what way we can help them most, Moms respond that they'd like to see us support youth sports. For this reason, we commit to raising $25 million globally. 2012 Honored in the Community The United Way—a non-profit organization that fights for health, education, and financial stability—celebrates its 125th Anniversary and awards us with The Spirit of America Award, their highest national honor for any corporation. We have always placed an emphasis on supporting the communities where we’re located, starting with Cincinnati’s first coordinated community charity in 1915 following devastating floods in the region. 12342005 Tide Loads of Hope The program is launched to help families hit by natural disaster by washing, drying, and folding laundry for them. By 2012, we cleaned more than 34,000 loads of laundry for families affected by disasters, including Hurricane Katrina, the San Diego wildfires, Hurricane Ike and more. In 2017 alone, the Tide Loads of Hope program washes 3,100 loads of laundry. 2004 Children's Safe Drinking Water An employee looks into cleaning water so moms in an African village could do laundry easier. As his team works on a way to reuse the wash water, they leverage P&G laundry technology and soon realize they could get it so clean you could drink it. So instead of laundry, they bring families clean drinking water—a much more important need. 1978 Dawn Wildlife Rescue International Bird Rescue begins testing all major dish soaps for cleaning and discovers that Dawn works the best. It’s the only product strong enough to remove the oil, yet gentle enough to not harm the integrity of the feathers. Since then, P&G has donated over 50,000 bottles and helped more than 75,000 animals. 123Products that broke the moldP&G history is full of never-before-seen innovations that solved problems and inspired the industry to catch up. OUR FUTURE Inventing the Products We Need Partnering with experts & innovators inside and outside our walls, we’re identifying what consumer needs aren’t being met, and developing tech to solve them. Check out what we’re working on now. 2001 The First Razor Designed Specifically for Women For the first time, Gillette asks women about their shaving experience, not just their shaving needs. Venus is developed after recognizing the key differences between men’s and women’s shaving. Using our best blades, Venus incorporates rounded cartridges, anti-bacterial rubber, and in-shower ergonomics and packaging. 1961 Dandruff, Solved Consumers were dissatisfied with existing anti-dandruff shampoos. After 10 years of research, our scientists discovered Pyrithione Zinc, an ingredient that reduces dandruff. We introduce it as Head & Shoulders in 1961 and it quickly becomes one of P&G’s biggest brands. In 1988, we launch is as our first brand in China. 1955 Preventing Tooth Decay Our researchers collaborate with Indiana University to develop the first stable fluoride toothpaste. Crest is introduced and becomes the first toothpaste with fluoride clinically proven to fight cavities and help prevent tooth decay—the second-most prevalent disease at the time. We also start reaching out to dentists, enlisting them to help prevent oral care issues rather than just repairing them—dramatically changing the way people think about taking care of their teeth. In 1960, the American Dental Association recognizes Crest as effective against cavities, catapulting the brands credibility. 12341949 The Soft Toothbrush A California dentist invents Oral-B toothbrushes using soft nylon bristles, out of concern for his patients gums. As a small entrepreneur, he sells them only to his dentist friends who in turn recommend the brand to their patients. Oral-B will grow to become one of the largest global brush brands. 1946 Tide, The Washday Miracle In 1933, Dreft is introduced as the first-ever household synthetic detergent, but research continues to develop a product that can clean consumer’s toughest stains. After almost a decade of failed work, the project is ordered to stop. But for 7 years, the lead researcher secretly works on the product in his spare time. By 1946, he has created a game changing product which is introduced as Tide. Called “The Washday Miracle”, it cleans better than anything on the market. 1879 The Soap That Floats James N. Gamble, son of the founder, recognizes that families must have 2 different bars of soap—one for laundry and one for bathing. He creates an innovative single bar of soap that works for both purposes. Named Ivory Soap, it takes the country by storm as one of the company’s most legendary brands. 123Tech that revolutionized the industryIf there’s one thing we know, it’s that there’s always a smarter, more efficient, simply better way of doing things. This principle has led to P&G products that have changed the way categories think. OUR FUTURE Keeping the Gears Moving We’re constantly working to propel the industry into the future whether it’s with product and packaging innovations, coming up with creative ways to use data, or finding ways to reinvent our business model. 2012 Tide Pods Designed as a detergent + stain remover + brightener in one, Tide Pods breaks through the laundry category. The pods deliver a new formula in a small dose that is HE compatible and twice as compacted as the current 2x Tide Liquid. 1998 Changing the Aircare Category One the biggest unmet consumer needs is finding a way to clean things that can’t go into the washing machine. With that problem in mind Procter & Gamble invents Febreze, a product that doesn’t just cover up bad scent, but actually removes it. 1986 Invention of 2-in-1 Our researchers set out to perfect a formula that cleans, lathers, rinses, and conditions in one convenient step. After more than three years of work, we launch the first “2-in-1” shampoo and conditioner on the market and expand that technology to Head & Shoulders, Pantene, and Vidal Sassoon. 12341965 A New Way to Make Paper Recognizing that people could only buy paper that was either soft or strong, Charmin creates a new way to allow for both in the same tissue, calling it CPF. With this new technology comes the famous ad campaign, “Please don’t squeeze the Charmin”. 1901 Improving the Razor King C. Gillette patents the KC Gillette Razor, an alternative to the straight razor. A breakthrough in the category, its permanent handle and disposable blade provides men with a safe and convenient way to shave. 12Practices that improve people's livesProviding customers with quality products that make every day better has driven our purpose for over 180 years. OUR FUTURE Ingredient Transparency We’re committed to continuing to be transparent about the ingredients we use (and don’t use) so that you can be confident when you add P&G products to your cart. See our fragrance ingredients list here. 2007 P&G in Your Neighborhood Tide Dry Cleaners launches in 2008 and is P&G’s big move into the service industry. It is quickly franchised across the country and in the first two years, serves over 500,000 customers, processes over 3.4 million garments, and creates over 150 jobs. 1941 Talking to Consumers We become one of the first companies to formally respond to consumer correspondence. By 1974, toll-free phone numbers allow consumers to contact us directly. By the 1990s, we incorporate email, and by the 2000s, social media makes connecting with consumers easier than ever. In 2011, we invent a listening solution which lets brands monitor what people are saying about their products in real-time. 1924 Start of Market Research D. Paul "Doc" Smelser, a Ph.D. economist from Johns Hopkins University, joins the team. He collects statistical data breaking out consumers by income and background, making us the first company to conduct deliberate, data-based market research with consumers. This allows us to improve consumer understanding and anticipate their needs to create products that improve everyday life. 12341890 First R&D Lab R&D quickly becomes a critical function at P&G and our first lab is added to the Ivorydale facility. By the 1920s, R&D is an integrated division of our company, employing a staff of several hundred young men and women. The Research Department develops ways to improve products, then passes their findings on to be translated into new manufacturing processes. 1887 Honest Business Ethics P&G products, known for their reputation for quality and being made by a company built on ethics, begin to be recognized through the slogan “Highest Grade, Honest Weight”. A retailer in Chicago, Illinois carries nothing but P&G products due to the demand for trusted products. 1886 An Industrial Masterpiece After a disastrous fire at our first plant, Ivorydale is purposefully built as a modern manufacturing facility. Designed by one of the nation's foremost industrial architects, Solon Beman, the new plant incorporates the latest designs for the safety and comfort of employees. We spend the next 130+ years expanding these manufacturing principles across the globe. 123A company that puts people firstWhat allows us to be one of the largest consumer goods company in the world is filling our buildings with passionate, inspired, motivated people who believe in doing better than good, every day. OUR FUTURE Diversity in Everything We Do We believe in diversity & inclusion. That’s why we support it however we can—from creating flexible work schedules for our employees to building inclusive playgrounds for children with and without disabilities. Learn more about our efforts. 2005 Women in Saudi Arabia We become the first consumer goods company to be granted a license to hire women in Saudi Arabia. Since then, our Saudi team has made significant progress in incorporating the talents and insights of women, while still respecting cultural norms and values. 1992 Women in Senior Positions The percentage of women filling senior management positions increases from 5% in 1992 to 30% in 2011. That same year, over 43% of new management hires from the past 5 years are women. 1992 LGBTQ+ Rights P&G includes sexual orientation in its Equal Employment Opportunity statement. The following year we support the creation of an internal grassroots organization known as GABLE and its efforts for LGBTQ+ inclusion within the company. 12341962 Diversity Programming Two years before the U.S. government mandates it, we initiate a diversity program for all employees—providing training and support to grow leaders regardless of sex, race, or religious orientation. 1905 Education Equality James N. Gamble helps establish what becomes the Bethune-Cookman University. This is just the beginning to the company’s long tradition of supporting historically black colleges and universities. 12Sustainable steps to a brighter futureA snapshot of all our sustainability achievements and efforts. OUR FUTURE Ambition 2030 During Earth Week in 2018, we released new sustainability goals for 2030 with one purpose in mind: to make a positive impact on our environment while creating value for our consumers. Learn more about our plan to address finite resources and growing consumption. 2016 World's 1st Beach Plastic Shampoo Bottle Head & Shoulders produces a bottle made from up to 25% recycled beach plastic—the first major step in establishing a unique supply chain involving thousands of volunteers and hundreds of NGOs. 2013 Making Zero Waste a Reality We announce during Earth Week that 45 P&G sites around the world have achieved zero-manufacturing-waste-to-landfill status, leading us to set bigger goals for 2030. 2005 Coldwater Technology 80-85% of energy used in the laundry process is used to heat water. After researchers discover the environmental impact of that, we design Coldwater Technology to deliver optimal performance at lower temperatures. 12342003 Environmentally-Responsible Flushables We lead the development of guidelines for flushable products published by The Water Environment Research Foundation. 1989 A New Life for Plastics We start using recycled plastic in our packaging, but our use of recycled polypropylene (PP) is limited due to a lack of availability of high-quality material. We need a solution, so one of our scientists invent a sustainable technology that recycles a type of plastic that wasn’t recyclable before—helping us reduce even more waste. 1983 Reducing Packaging & Water Use Triple Concentrate Downy makes its debut as one of P&G’s first products to reduce packaging and water use. Over the years, we improve this responsible tech across other products like Dawn, Fairy, Tide, and Ariel. 1956 Establishing the Importance of Safety The first environmental safety publication at P&G is published, providing research on surfactants (like emulsifiers, detergents, and foaming agents) in rivers. This topic continues to be important to P&G as demonstrated by the biological monitoring program at our paper manufacturing plants in 1969 and the release of our first Annual Global Environmental Report in 1993. 1234Take a look at where we are todaySee our BrandsCommunity impactWho we areBrandsWho we areCommunity impactSustainability

P&G History - A legacy of forward-thinkingP&G History.A legacy of forward-thinkingFor more than 185 years, we’ve challenged the norm and inspired the future—from the products we put on the shelf to the people we bring on our team. Click a category to explore the events that made us who we are today. Click to jump to each section. Serendipitous momentsSocial effortsInnovative productsRevolutionary techEveryday practicesPutting people firstSustainable effortsMoments of brillianceSerendipitous strokes of genius and passion-fueled ideas launched iconic brands and defined us as a company. OUR FUTURE Open Call for Ideas Our Connect + Develop program helps us partner with innovators around the world to solve problems for our consumers’ needs. Learn more. 2000 A Food Wrap That Whitens Teeth: Glad Press’n Seal & Crest Whitestrips To combat plastic wrap that loses its grip, P&G develops a technology to create Glad Press’n Seal. At the same time, a young employee working on at-home teeth whitening products connects with his mentor who shares a prototype of the food wrap with him. Sparked by this new idea, they cut the wrap into small strips, and apply it to their teeth. Shortly after, Crest Whitestrips is developed. 1998 One Insight That Led to Easier Cleaning for All: Always & Swiffer Wet Jet A consumer explained to a Products Researcher that while she liked Mr. Clean liquid, it didn’t make the cleaning process any easier. She opened her broom closet—full of mops, brushes, and buckets—and asked him to clean that up. Our researchers combine our capabilities in highly absorbent non-wovens, like the ones used in Always and Pampers, with our cleaner solutions expertise, creating both the Swiffer Wet Jet and the Quick Clean category. 1973 A Softener for the Dryer: Bounce With the addition of dryers in homes, static cling becomes a key issue. P&G finds a new way to deliver fabric softener via a towel. Research quickly led us to an inventor who had already figured it out, and we acquired the technology. Bounce dryer sheets are introduced as a fresh alternative to liquid fabric softeners. 12341961 A Grandfather Inspired by His Grandson: Pampers While watching his first grandchild, a P&G researcher quickly realizes the mess of cloth diapers and the need to carry them until returning home. This leads him and fellow researchers to develop a better & more affordable disposable diaper. Since then, Pampers has continuously advanced—moving from pins to tapes, becoming thinner and more cloth-like, and designed for babies at every stage of development. 1894 A Father's Concern: VapoRub A pharmacist developed several home remedies, such as cough syrups and other liquids that he sold in his local store. One day his infant son became ill. Unsure any of the ingestible products would be effective, he creates an externally-applied salve that releases cough-soothing vapors when heated by the body. His son’s health improves, and generations around the world grow up with VapoRub. 12A corporate force for goodOur employees have been the driving force behind our support for our environment, communities, and people—a practice that has been ingrained in our culture for over a century. OUR FUTURE Building Our Impact Each year, we actively continue to integrate Citizenship into how we do business. The more we do that, the bigger the impact we can make with the people we serve, the communities where we live and work, and the broader world that surrounds us. See what we’re up to now. 2015 Always’ #LikeAGirl The 2015 Super Bowl’s most-liked commercial changes the conversation about girls and sports, taking an unintentionally derogatory phrase and making it one of empowerment, strength, and pride. Millions of girls around the world rally to change #LikeAGirl to mean amazing things. This massive engagement starts to change public perception: while only 19% of girls had a positive association with the phrase “like a girl” before the campaign, 76% agree they no longer view the phrase as an insult after watching the Always #LikeAGirl film. 2012 Summer Olympics Campaign After the success of our 2010 “Proud Sponsor of Moms” campaign, we launch “Thank You, Mom"—a campaign where we support 150 global athletes and their Moms. When asked in what way we can help them most, Moms respond that they'd like to see us support youth sports. For this reason, we commit to raising $25 million globally. 2012 Honored in the Community The United Way—a non-profit organization that fights for health, education, and financial stability—celebrates its 125th Anniversary and awards us with The Spirit of America Award, their highest national honor for any corporation. We have always placed an emphasis on supporting the communities where we’re located, starting with Cincinnati’s first coordinated community charity in 1915 following devastating floods in the region. 12342005 Tide Loads of Hope The program is launched to help families hit by natural disaster by washing, drying, and folding laundry for them. By 2012, we cleaned more than 34,000 loads of laundry for families affected by disasters, including Hurricane Katrina, the San Diego wildfires, Hurricane Ike and more. In 2017 alone, the Tide Loads of Hope program washes 3,100 loads of laundry. 2004 Children's Safe Drinking Water An employee looks into cleaning water so moms in an African village could do laundry easier. As his team works on a way to reuse the wash water, they leverage P&G laundry technology and soon realize they could get it so clean you could drink it. So instead of laundry, they bring families clean drinking water—a much more important need. 1978 Dawn Wildlife Rescue International Bird Rescue begins testing all major dish soaps for cleaning and discovers that Dawn works the best. It’s the only product strong enough to remove the oil, yet gentle enough to not harm the integrity of the feathers. Since then, P&G has donated over 50,000 bottles and helped more than 75,000 animals. 123Products that broke the moldP&G history is full of never-before-seen innovations that solved problems and inspired the industry to catch up. OUR FUTURE Inventing the Products We Need Partnering with experts & innovators inside and outside our walls, we’re identifying what consumer needs aren’t being met, and developing tech to solve them. Check out what we’re working on now. 2001 The First Razor Designed Specifically for Women For the first time, Gillette asks women about their shaving experience, not just their shaving needs. Venus is developed after recognizing the key differences between men’s and women’s shaving. Using our best blades, Venus incorporates rounded cartridges, anti-bacterial rubber, and in-shower ergonomics and packaging. 1961 Dandruff, Solved Consumers were dissatisfied with existing anti-dandruff shampoos. After 10 years of research, our scientists discovered Pyrithione Zinc, an ingredient that reduces dandruff. We introduce it as Head & Shoulders in 1961 and it quickly becomes one of P&G’s biggest brands. In 1988, we launch is as our first brand in China. 1955 Preventing Tooth Decay Our researchers collaborate with Indiana University to develop the first stable fluoride toothpaste. Crest is introduced and becomes the first toothpaste with fluoride clinically proven to fight cavities and help prevent tooth decay—the second-most prevalent disease at the time. We also start reaching out to dentists, enlisting them to help prevent oral care issues rather than just repairing them—dramatically changing the way people think about taking care of their teeth. In 1960, the American Dental Association recognizes Crest as effective against cavities, catapulting the brands credibility. 12341949 The Soft Toothbrush A California dentist invents Oral-B toothbrushes using soft nylon bristles, out of concern for his patients gums. As a small entrepreneur, he sells them only to his dentist friends who in turn recommend the brand to their patients. Oral-B will grow to become one of the largest global brush brands. 1946 Tide, The Washday Miracle In 1933, Dreft is introduced as the first-ever household synthetic detergent, but research continues to develop a product that can clean consumer’s toughest stains. After almost a decade of failed work, the project is ordered to stop. But for 7 years, the lead researcher secretly works on the product in his spare time. By 1946, he has created a game changing product which is introduced as Tide. Called “The Washday Miracle”, it cleans better than anything on the market. 1879 The Soap That Floats James N. Gamble, son of the founder, recognizes that families must have 2 different bars of soap—one for laundry and one for bathing. He creates an innovative single bar of soap that works for both purposes. Named Ivory Soap, it takes the country by storm as one of the company’s most legendary brands. 123Tech that revolutionized the industryIf there’s one thing we know, it’s that there’s always a smarter, more efficient, simply better way of doing things. This principle has led to P&G products that have changed the way categories think. OUR FUTURE Keeping the Gears Moving We’re constantly working to propel the industry into the future whether it’s with product and packaging innovations, coming up with creative ways to use data, or finding ways to reinvent our business model. 2012 Tide Pods Designed as a detergent + stain remover + brightener in one, Tide Pods breaks through the laundry category. The pods deliver a new formula in a small dose that is HE compatible and twice as compacted as the current 2x Tide Liquid. 1998 Changing the Aircare Category One the biggest unmet consumer needs is finding a way to clean things that can’t go into the washing machine. With that problem in mind Procter & Gamble invents Febreze, a product that doesn’t just cover up bad scent, but actually removes it. 1986 Invention of 2-in-1 Our researchers set out to perfect a formula that cleans, lathers, rinses, and conditions in one convenient step. After more than three years of work, we launch the first “2-in-1” shampoo and conditioner on the market and expand that technology to Head & Shoulders, Pantene, and Vidal Sassoon. 12341965 A New Way to Make Paper Recognizing that people could only buy paper that was either soft or strong, Charmin creates a new way to allow for both in the same tissue, calling it CPF. With this new technology comes the famous ad campaign, “Please don’t squeeze the Charmin”. 1901 Improving the Razor King C. Gillette patents the KC Gillette Razor, an alternative to the straight razor. A breakthrough in the category, its permanent handle and disposable blade provides men with a safe and convenient way to shave. 12Practices that improve people's livesProviding customers with quality products that make every day better has driven our purpose for over 180 years. OUR FUTURE Ingredient Transparency We’re committed to continuing to be transparent about the ingredients we use (and don’t use) so that you can be confident when you add P&G products to your cart. See our fragrance ingredients list here. 2007 P&G in Your Neighborhood Tide Dry Cleaners launches in 2008 and is P&G’s big move into the service industry. It is quickly franchised across the country and in the first two years, serves over 500,000 customers, processes over 3.4 million garments, and creates over 150 jobs. 1941 Talking to Consumers We become one of the first companies to formally respond to consumer correspondence. By 1974, toll-free phone numbers allow consumers to contact us directly. By the 1990s, we incorporate email, and by the 2000s, social media makes connecting with consumers easier than ever. In 2011, we invent a listening solution which lets brands monitor what people are saying about their products in real-time. 1924 Start of Market Research D. Paul "Doc" Smelser, a Ph.D. economist from Johns Hopkins University, joins the team. He collects statistical data breaking out consumers by income and background, making us the first company to conduct deliberate, data-based market research with consumers. This allows us to improve consumer understanding and anticipate their needs to create products that improve everyday life. 12341890 First R&D Lab R&D quickly becomes a critical function at P&G and our first lab is added to the Ivorydale facility. By the 1920s, R&D is an integrated division of our company, employing a staff of several hundred young men and women. The Research Department develops ways to improve products, then passes their findings on to be translated into new manufacturing processes. 1887 Honest Business Ethics P&G products, known for their reputation for quality and being made by a company built on ethics, begin to be recognized through the slogan “Highest Grade, Honest Weight”. A retailer in Chicago, Illinois carries nothing but P&G products due to the demand for trusted products. 1886 An Industrial Masterpiece After a disastrous fire at our first plant, Ivorydale is purposefully built as a modern manufacturing facility. Designed by one of the nation's foremost industrial architects, Solon Beman, the new plant incorporates the latest designs for the safety and comfort of employees. We spend the next 130+ years expanding these manufacturing principles across the globe. 123A company that puts people firstWhat allows us to be one of the largest consumer goods company in the world is filling our buildings with passionate, inspired, motivated people who believe in doing better than good, every day. OUR FUTURE Diversity in Everything We Do We believe in diversity & inclusion. That’s why we support it however we can—from creating flexible work schedules for our employees to building inclusive playgrounds for children with and without disabilities. Learn more about our efforts. 2005 Women in Saudi Arabia We become the first consumer goods company to be granted a license to hire women in Saudi Arabia. Since then, our Saudi team has made significant progress in incorporating the talents and insights of women, while still respecting cultural norms and values. 1992 Women in Senior Positions The percentage of women filling senior management positions increases from 5% in 1992 to 30% in 2011. That same year, over 43% of new management hires from the past 5 years are women. 1992 LGBTQ+ Rights P&G includes sexual orientation in its Equal Employment Opportunity statement. The following year we support the creation of an internal grassroots organization known as GABLE and its efforts for LGBTQ+ inclusion within the company. 12341962 Diversity Programming Two years before the U.S. government mandates it, we initiate a diversity program for all employees—providing training and support to grow leaders regardless of sex, race, or religious orientation. 1905 Education Equality James N. Gamble helps establish what becomes the Bethune-Cookman University. This is just the beginning to the company’s long tradition of supporting historically black colleges and universities. 12Sustainable steps to a brighter futureA snapshot of all our sustainability achievements and efforts. OUR FUTURE Ambition 2030 During Earth Week in 2018, we released new sustainability goals for 2030 with one purpose in mind: to make a positive impact on our environment while creating value for our consumers. Learn more about our plan to address finite resources and growing consumption. 2016 World's 1st Beach Plastic Shampoo Bottle Head & Shoulders produces a bottle made from up to 25% recycled beach plastic—the first major step in establishing a unique supply chain involving thousands of volunteers and hundreds of NGOs. 2013 Making Zero Waste a Reality We announce during Earth Week that 45 P&G sites around the world have achieved zero-manufacturing-waste-to-landfill status, leading us to set bigger goals for 2030. 2005 Coldwater Technology 80-85% of energy used in the laundry process is used to heat water. After researchers discover the environmental impact of that, we design Coldwater Technology to deliver optimal performance at lower temperatures. 12342003 Environmentally-Responsible Flushables We lead the development of guidelines for flushable products published by The Water Environment Research Foundation. 1989 A New Life for Plastics We start using recycled plastic in our packaging, but our use of recycled polypropylene (PP) is limited due to a lack of availability of high-quality material. We need a solution, so one of our scientists invent a sustainable technology that recycles a type of plastic that wasn’t recyclable before—helping us reduce even more waste. 1983 Reducing Packaging & Water Use Triple Concentrate Downy makes its debut as one of P&G’s first products to reduce packaging and water use. Over the years, we improve this responsible tech across other products like Dawn, Fairy, Tide, and Ariel. 1956 Establishing the Importance of Safety The first environmental safety publication at P&G is published, providing research on surfactants (like emulsifiers, detergents, and foaming agents) in rivers. This topic continues to be important to P&G as demonstrated by the biological monitoring program at our paper manufacturing plants in 1969 and the release of our first Annual Global Environmental Report in 1993. 1234Take a look at where we are todaySee our BrandsCommunity impactWho we areBrandsWho we areCommunity impactSustainability

Serendipitous momentsSocial effortsInnovative productsRevolutionary techEveryday practicesPutting people firstSustainable effortsMoments of brillianceSerendipitous strokes of genius and passion-fueled ideas launched iconic brands and defined us as a company. OUR FUTURE Open Call for Ideas Our Connect + Develop program helps us partner with innovators around the world to solve problems for our consumers’ needs. Learn more. 2000 A Food Wrap That Whitens Teeth: Glad Press’n Seal & Crest Whitestrips To combat plastic wrap that loses its grip, P&G develops a technology to create Glad Press’n Seal. At the same time, a young employee working on at-home teeth whitening products connects with his mentor who shares a prototype of the food wrap with him. Sparked by this new idea, they cut the wrap into small strips, and apply it to their teeth. Shortly after, Crest Whitestrips is developed. 1998 One Insight That Led to Easier Cleaning for All: Always & Swiffer Wet Jet A consumer explained to a Products Researcher that while she liked Mr. Clean liquid, it didn’t make the cleaning process any easier. She opened her broom closet—full of mops, brushes, and buckets—and asked him to clean that up. Our researchers combine our capabilities in highly absorbent non-wovens, like the ones used in Always and Pampers, with our cleaner solutions expertise, creating both the Swiffer Wet Jet and the Quick Clean category. 1973 A Softener for the Dryer: Bounce With the addition of dryers in homes, static cling becomes a key issue. P&G finds a new way to deliver fabric softener via a towel. Research quickly led us to an inventor who had already figured it out, and we acquired the technology. Bounce dryer sheets are introduced as a fresh alternative to liquid fabric softeners. 12341961 A Grandfather Inspired by His Grandson: Pampers While watching his first grandchild, a P&G researcher quickly realizes the mess of cloth diapers and the need to carry them until returning home. This leads him and fellow researchers to develop a better & more affordable disposable diaper. Since then, Pampers has continuously advanced—moving from pins to tapes, becoming thinner and more cloth-like, and designed for babies at every stage of development. 1894 A Father's Concern: VapoRub A pharmacist developed several home remedies, such as cough syrups and other liquids that he sold in his local store. One day his infant son became ill. Unsure any of the ingestible products would be effective, he creates an externally-applied salve that releases cough-soothing vapors when heated by the body. His son’s health improves, and generations around the world grow up with VapoRub. 12A corporate force for goodOur employees have been the driving force behind our support for our environment, communities, and people—a practice that has been ingrained in our culture for over a century. OUR FUTURE Building Our Impact Each year, we actively continue to integrate Citizenship into how we do business. The more we do that, the bigger the impact we can make with the people we serve, the communities where we live and work, and the broader world that surrounds us. See what we’re up to now. 2015 Always’ #LikeAGirl The 2015 Super Bowl’s most-liked commercial changes the conversation about girls and sports, taking an unintentionally derogatory phrase and making it one of empowerment, strength, and pride. Millions of girls around the world rally to change #LikeAGirl to mean amazing things. This massive engagement starts to change public perception: while only 19% of girls had a positive association with the phrase “like a girl” before the campaign, 76% agree they no longer view the phrase as an insult after watching the Always #LikeAGirl film. 2012 Summer Olympics Campaign After the success of our 2010 “Proud Sponsor of Moms” campaign, we launch “Thank You, Mom"—a campaign where we support 150 global athletes and their Moms. When asked in what way we can help them most, Moms respond that they'd like to see us support youth sports. For this reason, we commit to raising $25 million globally. 2012 Honored in the Community The United Way—a non-profit organization that fights for health, education, and financial stability—celebrates its 125th Anniversary and awards us with The Spirit of America Award, their highest national honor for any corporation. We have always placed an emphasis on supporting the communities where we’re located, starting with Cincinnati’s first coordinated community charity in 1915 following devastating floods in the region. 12342005 Tide Loads of Hope The program is launched to help families hit by natural disaster by washing, drying, and folding laundry for them. By 2012, we cleaned more than 34,000 loads of laundry for families affected by disasters, including Hurricane Katrina, the San Diego wildfires, Hurricane Ike and more. In 2017 alone, the Tide Loads of Hope program washes 3,100 loads of laundry. 2004 Children's Safe Drinking Water An employee looks into cleaning water so moms in an African village could do laundry easier. As his team works on a way to reuse the wash water, they leverage P&G laundry technology and soon realize they could get it so clean you could drink it. So instead of laundry, they bring families clean drinking water—a much more important need. 1978 Dawn Wildlife Rescue International Bird Rescue begins testing all major dish soaps for cleaning and discovers that Dawn works the best. It’s the only product strong enough to remove the oil, yet gentle enough to not harm the integrity of the feathers. Since then, P&G has donated over 50,000 bottles and helped more than 75,000 animals. 123Products that broke the moldP&G history is full of never-before-seen innovations that solved problems and inspired the industry to catch up. OUR FUTURE Inventing the Products We Need Partnering with experts & innovators inside and outside our walls, we’re identifying what consumer needs aren’t being met, and developing tech to solve them. Check out what we’re working on now. 2001 The First Razor Designed Specifically for Women For the first time, Gillette asks women about their shaving experience, not just their shaving needs. Venus is developed after recognizing the key differences between men’s and women’s shaving. Using our best blades, Venus incorporates rounded cartridges, anti-bacterial rubber, and in-shower ergonomics and packaging. 1961 Dandruff, Solved Consumers were dissatisfied with existing anti-dandruff shampoos. After 10 years of research, our scientists discovered Pyrithione Zinc, an ingredient that reduces dandruff. We introduce it as Head & Shoulders in 1961 and it quickly becomes one of P&G’s biggest brands. In 1988, we launch is as our first brand in China. 1955 Preventing Tooth Decay Our researchers collaborate with Indiana University to develop the first stable fluoride toothpaste. Crest is introduced and becomes the first toothpaste with fluoride clinically proven to fight cavities and help prevent tooth decay—the second-most prevalent disease at the time. We also start reaching out to dentists, enlisting them to help prevent oral care issues rather than just repairing them—dramatically changing the way people think about taking care of their teeth. In 1960, the American Dental Association recognizes Crest as effective against cavities, catapulting the brands credibility. 12341949 The Soft Toothbrush A California dentist invents Oral-B toothbrushes using soft nylon bristles, out of concern for his patients gums. As a small entrepreneur, he sells them only to his dentist friends who in turn recommend the brand to their patients. Oral-B will grow to become one of the largest global brush brands. 1946 Tide, The Washday Miracle In 1933, Dreft is introduced as the first-ever household synthetic detergent, but research continues to develop a product that can clean consumer’s toughest stains. After almost a decade of failed work, the project is ordered to stop. But for 7 years, the lead researcher secretly works on the product in his spare time. By 1946, he has created a game changing product which is introduced as Tide. Called “The Washday Miracle”, it cleans better than anything on the market. 1879 The Soap That Floats James N. Gamble, son of the founder, recognizes that families must have 2 different bars of soap—one for laundry and one for bathing. He creates an innovative single bar of soap that works for both purposes. Named Ivory Soap, it takes the country by storm as one of the company’s most legendary brands. 123Tech that revolutionized the industryIf there’s one thing we know, it’s that there’s always a smarter, more efficient, simply better way of doing things. This principle has led to P&G products that have changed the way categories think. OUR FUTURE Keeping the Gears Moving We’re constantly working to propel the industry into the future whether it’s with product and packaging innovations, coming up with creative ways to use data, or finding ways to reinvent our business model. 2012 Tide Pods Designed as a detergent + stain remover + brightener in one, Tide Pods breaks through the laundry category. The pods deliver a new formula in a small dose that is HE compatible and twice as compacted as the current 2x Tide Liquid. 1998 Changing the Aircare Category One the biggest unmet consumer needs is finding a way to clean things that can’t go into the washing machine. With that problem in mind Procter & Gamble invents Febreze, a product that doesn’t just cover up bad scent, but actually removes it. 1986 Invention of 2-in-1 Our researchers set out to perfect a formula that cleans, lathers, rinses, and conditions in one convenient step. After more than three years of work, we launch the first “2-in-1” shampoo and conditioner on the market and expand that technology to Head & Shoulders, Pantene, and Vidal Sassoon. 12341965 A New Way to Make Paper Recognizing that people could only buy paper that was either soft or strong, Charmin creates a new way to allow for both in the same tissue, calling it CPF. With this new technology comes the famous ad campaign, “Please don’t squeeze the Charmin”. 1901 Improving the Razor King C. Gillette patents the KC Gillette Razor, an alternative to the straight razor. A breakthrough in the category, its permanent handle and disposable blade provides men with a safe and convenient way to shave. 12Practices that improve people's livesProviding customers with quality products that make every day better has driven our purpose for over 180 years. OUR FUTURE Ingredient Transparency We’re committed to continuing to be transparent about the ingredients we use (and don’t use) so that you can be confident when you add P&G products to your cart. See our fragrance ingredients list here. 2007 P&G in Your Neighborhood Tide Dry Cleaners launches in 2008 and is P&G’s big move into the service industry. It is quickly franchised across the country and in the first two years, serves over 500,000 customers, processes over 3.4 million garments, and creates over 150 jobs. 1941 Talking to Consumers We become one of the first companies to formally respond to consumer correspondence. By 1974, toll-free phone numbers allow consumers to contact us directly. By the 1990s, we incorporate email, and by the 2000s, social media makes connecting with consumers easier than ever. In 2011, we invent a listening solution which lets brands monitor what people are saying about their products in real-time. 1924 Start of Market Research D. Paul "Doc" Smelser, a Ph.D. economist from Johns Hopkins University, joins the team. He collects statistical data breaking out consumers by income and background, making us the first company to conduct deliberate, data-based market research with consumers. This allows us to improve consumer understanding and anticipate their needs to create products that improve everyday life. 12341890 First R&D Lab R&D quickly becomes a critical function at P&G and our first lab is added to the Ivorydale facility. By the 1920s, R&D is an integrated division of our company, employing a staff of several hundred young men and women. The Research Department develops ways to improve products, then passes their findings on to be translated into new manufacturing processes. 1887 Honest Business Ethics P&G products, known for their reputation for quality and being made by a company built on ethics, begin to be recognized through the slogan “Highest Grade, Honest Weight”. A retailer in Chicago, Illinois carries nothing but P&G products due to the demand for trusted products. 1886 An Industrial Masterpiece After a disastrous fire at our first plant, Ivorydale is purposefully built as a modern manufacturing facility. Designed by one of the nation's foremost industrial architects, Solon Beman, the new plant incorporates the latest designs for the safety and comfort of employees. We spend the next 130+ years expanding these manufacturing principles across the globe. 123A company that puts people firstWhat allows us to be one of the largest consumer goods company in the world is filling our buildings with passionate, inspired, motivated people who believe in doing better than good, every day. OUR FUTURE Diversity in Everything We Do We believe in diversity & inclusion. That’s why we support it however we can—from creating flexible work schedules for our employees to building inclusive playgrounds for children with and without disabilities. Learn more about our efforts. 2005 Women in Saudi Arabia We become the first consumer goods company to be granted a license to hire women in Saudi Arabia. Since then, our Saudi team has made significant progress in incorporating the talents and insights of women, while still respecting cultural norms and values. 1992 Women in Senior Positions The percentage of women filling senior management positions increases from 5% in 1992 to 30% in 2011. That same year, over 43% of new management hires from the past 5 years are women. 1992 LGBTQ+ Rights P&G includes sexual orientation in its Equal Employment Opportunity statement. The following year we support the creation of an internal grassroots organization known as GABLE and its efforts for LGBTQ+ inclusion within the company. 12341962 Diversity Programming Two years before the U.S. government mandates it, we initiate a diversity program for all employees—providing training and support to grow leaders regardless of sex, race, or religious orientation. 1905 Education Equality James N. Gamble helps establish what becomes the Bethune-Cookman University. This is just the beginning to the company’s long tradition of supporting historically black colleges and universities. 12Sustainable steps to a brighter futureA snapshot of all our sustainability achievements and efforts. OUR FUTURE Ambition 2030 During Earth Week in 2018, we released new sustainability goals for 2030 with one purpose in mind: to make a positive impact on our environment while creating value for our consumers. Learn more about our plan to address finite resources and growing consumption. 2016 World's 1st Beach Plastic Shampoo Bottle Head & Shoulders produces a bottle made from up to 25% recycled beach plastic—the first major step in establishing a unique supply chain involving thousands of volunteers and hundreds of NGOs. 2013 Making Zero Waste a Reality We announce during Earth Week that 45 P&G sites around the world have achieved zero-manufacturing-waste-to-landfill status, leading us to set bigger goals for 2030. 2005 Coldwater Technology 80-85% of energy used in the laundry process is used to heat water. After researchers discover the environmental impact of that, we design Coldwater Technology to deliver optimal performance at lower temperatures. 12342003 Environmentally-Responsible Flushables We lead the development of guidelines for flushable products published by The Water Environment Research Foundation. 1989 A New Life for Plastics We start using recycled plastic in our packaging, but our use of recycled polypropylene (PP) is limited due to a lack of availability of high-quality material. We need a solution, so one of our scientists invent a sustainable technology that recycles a type of plastic that wasn’t recyclable before—helping us reduce even more waste. 1983 Reducing Packaging & Water Use Triple Concentrate Downy makes its debut as one of P&G’s first products to reduce packaging and water use. Over the years, we improve this responsible tech across other products like Dawn, Fairy, Tide, and Ariel. 1956 Establishing the Importance of Safety The first environmental safety publication at P&G is published, providing research on surfactants (like emulsifiers, detergents, and foaming agents) in rivers. This topic continues to be important to P&G as demonstrated by the biological monitoring program at our paper manufacturing plants in 1969 and the release of our first Annual Global Environmental Report in 1993. 1234Take a look at where we are todaySee our BrandsCommunity impactWho we areBrandsWho we areCommunity impactSustainability

Gamble helps establish what becomes the Bethune-Cookman University. This is just the beginning to the company’s long tradition of supporting historically black colleges and universities. 12Sustainable steps to a brighter futureA snapshot of all our sustainability achievements and efforts. OUR FUTURE Ambition 2030 During Earth Week in 2018, we released new sustainability goals for 2030 with one purpose in mind: to make a positive impact on our environment while creating value for our consumers. Learn more about our plan to address finite resources and growing consumption. 2016 World's 1st Beach Plastic Shampoo Bottle Head & Shoulders produces a bottle made from up to 25% recycled beach plastic—the first major step in establishing a unique supply chain involving thousands of volunteers and hundreds of NGOs. 2013 Making Zero Waste a Reality We announce during Earth Week that 45 P&G sites around the world have achieved zero-manufacturing-waste-to-landfill status, leading us to set bigger goals for 2030. 2005 Coldwater Technology 80-85% of energy used in the laundry process is used to heat water. After researchers discover the environmental impact of that, we design Coldwater Technology to deliver optimal performance at lower temperatures. 12342003 Environmentally-Responsible Flushables We lead the development of guidelines for flushable products published by The Water Environment Research Foundation. 1989 A New Life for Plastics We start using recycled plastic in our packaging, but our use of recycled polypropylene (PP) is limited due to a lack of availability of high-quality material. We need a solution, so one of our scientists invent a sustainable technology that recycles a type of plastic that wasn’t recyclable before—helping us reduce even more waste. 1983 Reducing Packaging & Water Use Triple Concentrate Downy makes its debut as one of P&G’s first products to reduce packaging and water use. Over the years, we improve this responsible tech across other products like Dawn, Fairy, Tide, and Ariel. 1956 Establishing the Importance of Safety The first environmental safety publication at P&G is published, providing research on surfactants (like emulsifiers, detergents, and foaming agents) in rivers. This topic continues to be important to P&G as demonstrated by the biological monitoring program at our paper manufacturing plants in 1969 and the release of our first Annual Global Environmental Report in 1993. 1234Take a look at where we are todaySee our BrandsCommunity impactWho we areBrandsWho we areCommunity impactSustainability

Chemical Engineering, 1989 Date Joined P&G October 1, 1989 LinkedIn Profile R. Alexandra Keith R. Alexandra (Alex) Keith Chief Executive Officer, Beauty Executive Sponsor, Corporate Sustainability Alex Keith leads Procter & Gamble’s global Beauty business: the world’s 4th largest beauty company, with a $15 billion portfolio of products in daily-use categories where performance drives brand choice. This includes Pantene, the world’s largest hair care brand; Head & Shoulders, the world’s largest shampoo brand; Olay, the fifth largest skin care brand in the world, as well as iconic beauty brands Old Spice, Safeguard, Secret and SK-II. Since taking leadership of P&G’s Beauty portfolio in 2017, Alex has driven the sector’s turnaround by leveraging integrated growth strategies to stem seven years of decline with eight consecutive years of top-line growth. An intuitive, strategic business leader and passionate, creative brand builder, Alex has consistently enabled the development of P&G Beauty’s brand portfolio in response to consumers’ ever-evolving beauty needs, starting with the 2017 acquisition and ensuing expansion of Native, a brand known for clean, simple and effective products. In 2022, she led the creation of a Specialty Beauty division, helping P&G better reach consumers in the prestige beauty segment with acquired brands OUAI, Farmacy, Tula and First Aid Beauty. Recognizing growing demand for products serving multicultural hair types, Alex led the 2023 acquisition of textured hair care brand Mielle Organics. As Executive Sponsor for Corporate Sustainability, Alex works alongside P&G’s Chief Sustainability Officer to guide the Company’s sustainability progress, including programs like Ambition 2030 that have resulted in creation of P&G’s Climate Transition Action Plan (2021) and Plan for a Water Positive Future (2022).

P&G History - A legacy of forward-thinkingP&G History.A legacy of forward-thinkingFor more than 185 years, we’ve challenged the norm and inspired the future—from the products we put on the shelf to the people we bring on our team. Click a category to explore the events that made us who we are today. Click to jump to each section. Serendipitous momentsSocial effortsInnovative productsRevolutionary techEveryday practicesPutting people firstSustainable effortsMoments of brillianceSerendipitous strokes of genius and passion-fueled ideas launched iconic brands and defined us as a company. OUR FUTURE Open Call for Ideas Our Connect + Develop program helps us partner with innovators around the world to solve problems for our consumers’ needs. Learn more. 2000 A Food Wrap That Whitens Teeth: Glad Press’n Seal & Crest Whitestrips To combat plastic wrap that loses its grip, P&G develops a technology to create Glad Press’n Seal. At the same time, a young employee working on at-home teeth whitening products connects with his mentor who shares a prototype of the food wrap with him. Sparked by this new idea, they cut the wrap into small strips, and apply it to their teeth. Shortly after, Crest Whitestrips is developed. 1998 One Insight That Led to Easier Cleaning for All: Always & Swiffer Wet Jet A consumer explained to a Products Researcher that while she liked Mr. Clean liquid, it didn’t make the cleaning process any easier. She opened her broom closet—full of mops, brushes, and buckets—and asked him to clean that up. Our researchers combine our capabilities in highly absorbent non-wovens, like the ones used in Always and Pampers, with our cleaner solutions expertise, creating both the Swiffer Wet Jet and the Quick Clean category. 1973 A Softener for the Dryer: Bounce With the addition of dryers in homes, static cling becomes a key issue. P&G finds a new way to deliver fabric softener via a towel. Research quickly led us to an inventor who had already figured it out, and we acquired the technology. Bounce dryer sheets are introduced as a fresh alternative to liquid fabric softeners. 12341961 A Grandfather Inspired by His Grandson: Pampers While watching his first grandchild, a P&G researcher quickly realizes the mess of cloth diapers and the need to carry them until returning home. This leads him and fellow researchers to develop a better & more affordable disposable diaper. Since then, Pampers has continuously advanced—moving from pins to tapes, becoming thinner and more cloth-like, and designed for babies at every stage of development. 1894 A Father's Concern: VapoRub A pharmacist developed several home remedies, such as cough syrups and other liquids that he sold in his local store. One day his infant son became ill. Unsure any of the ingestible products would be effective, he creates an externally-applied salve that releases cough-soothing vapors when heated by the body. His son’s health improves, and generations around the world grow up with VapoRub. 12A corporate force for goodOur employees have been the driving force behind our support for our environment, communities, and people—a practice that has been ingrained in our culture for over a century. OUR FUTURE Building Our Impact Each year, we actively continue to integrate Citizenship into how we do business. The more we do that, the bigger the impact we can make with the people we serve, the communities where we live and work, and the broader world that surrounds us. See what we’re up to now. 2015 Always’ #LikeAGirl The 2015 Super Bowl’s most-liked commercial changes the conversation about girls and sports, taking an unintentionally derogatory phrase and making it one of empowerment, strength, and pride. Millions of girls around the world rally to change #LikeAGirl to mean amazing things. This massive engagement starts to change public perception: while only 19% of girls had a positive association with the phrase “like a girl” before the campaign, 76% agree they no longer view the phrase as an insult after watching the Always #LikeAGirl film. 2012 Summer Olympics Campaign After the success of our 2010 “Proud Sponsor of Moms” campaign, we launch “Thank You, Mom"—a campaign where we support 150 global athletes and their Moms. When asked in what way we can help them most, Moms respond that they'd like to see us support youth sports. For this reason, we commit to raising $25 million globally. 2012 Honored in the Community The United Way—a non-profit organization that fights for health, education, and financial stability—celebrates its 125th Anniversary and awards us with The Spirit of America Award, their highest national honor for any corporation. We have always placed an emphasis on supporting the communities where we’re located, starting with Cincinnati’s first coordinated community charity in 1915 following devastating floods in the region. 12342005 Tide Loads of Hope The program is launched to help families hit by natural disaster by washing, drying, and folding laundry for them. By 2012, we cleaned more than 34,000 loads of laundry for families affected by disasters, including Hurricane Katrina, the San Diego wildfires, Hurricane Ike and more. In 2017 alone, the Tide Loads of Hope program washes 3,100 loads of laundry. 2004 Children's Safe Drinking Water An employee looks into cleaning water so moms in an African village could do laundry easier. As his team works on a way to reuse the wash water, they leverage P&G laundry technology and soon realize they could get it so clean you could drink it. So instead of laundry, they bring families clean drinking water—a much more important need. 1978 Dawn Wildlife Rescue International Bird Rescue begins testing all major dish soaps for cleaning and discovers that Dawn works the best. It’s the only product strong enough to remove the oil, yet gentle enough to not harm the integrity of the feathers. Since then, P&G has donated over 50,000 bottles and helped more than 75,000 animals. 123Products that broke the moldP&G history is full of never-before-seen innovations that solved problems and inspired the industry to catch up. OUR FUTURE Inventing the Products We Need Partnering with experts & innovators inside and outside our walls, we’re identifying what consumer needs aren’t being met, and developing tech to solve them. Check out what we’re working on now. 2001 The First Razor Designed Specifically for Women For the first time, Gillette asks women about their shaving experience, not just their shaving needs. Venus is developed after recognizing the key differences between men’s and women’s shaving. Using our best blades, Venus incorporates rounded cartridges, anti-bacterial rubber, and in-shower ergonomics and packaging. 1961 Dandruff, Solved Consumers were dissatisfied with existing anti-dandruff shampoos. After 10 years of research, our scientists discovered Pyrithione Zinc, an ingredient that reduces dandruff. We introduce it as Head & Shoulders in 1961 and it quickly becomes one of P&G’s biggest brands. In 1988, we launch is as our first brand in China. 1955 Preventing Tooth Decay Our researchers collaborate with Indiana University to develop the first stable fluoride toothpaste. Crest is introduced and becomes the first toothpaste with fluoride clinically proven to fight cavities and help prevent tooth decay—the second-most prevalent disease at the time. We also start reaching out to dentists, enlisting them to help prevent oral care issues rather than just repairing them—dramatically changing the way people think about taking care of their teeth. In 1960, the American Dental Association recognizes Crest as effective against cavities, catapulting the brands credibility. 12341949 The Soft Toothbrush A California dentist invents Oral-B toothbrushes using soft nylon bristles, out of concern for his patients gums. As a small entrepreneur, he sells them only to his dentist friends who in turn recommend the brand to their patients. Oral-B will grow to become one of the largest global brush brands. 1946 Tide, The Washday Miracle In 1933, Dreft is introduced as the first-ever household synthetic detergent, but research continues to develop a product that can clean consumer’s toughest stains. After almost a decade of failed work, the project is ordered to stop. But for 7 years, the lead researcher secretly works on the product in his spare time. By 1946, he has created a game changing product which is introduced as Tide. Called “The Washday Miracle”, it cleans better than anything on the market. 1879 The Soap That Floats James N. Gamble, son of the founder, recognizes that families must have 2 different bars of soap—one for laundry and one for bathing. He creates an innovative single bar of soap that works for both purposes. Named Ivory Soap, it takes the country by storm as one of the company’s most legendary brands. 123Tech that revolutionized the industryIf there’s one thing we know, it’s that there’s always a smarter, more efficient, simply better way of doing things. This principle has led to P&G products that have changed the way categories think. OUR FUTURE Keeping the Gears Moving We’re constantly working to propel the industry into the future whether it’s with product and packaging innovations, coming up with creative ways to use data, or finding ways to reinvent our business model. 2012 Tide Pods Designed as a detergent + stain remover + brightener in one, Tide Pods breaks through the laundry category. The pods deliver a new formula in a small dose that is HE compatible and twice as compacted as the current 2x Tide Liquid. 1998 Changing the Aircare Category One the biggest unmet consumer needs is finding a way to clean things that can’t go into the washing machine. With that problem in mind Procter & Gamble invents Febreze, a product that doesn’t just cover up bad scent, but actually removes it. 1986 Invention of 2-in-1 Our researchers set out to perfect a formula that cleans, lathers, rinses, and conditions in one convenient step. After more than three years of work, we launch the first “2-in-1” shampoo and conditioner on the market and expand that technology to Head & Shoulders, Pantene, and Vidal Sassoon. 12341965 A New Way to Make Paper Recognizing that people could only buy paper that was either soft or strong, Charmin creates a new way to allow for both in the same tissue, calling it CPF. With this new technology comes the famous ad campaign, “Please don’t squeeze the Charmin”. 1901 Improving the Razor King C. Gillette patents the KC Gillette Razor, an alternative to the straight razor. A breakthrough in the category, its permanent handle and disposable blade provides men with a safe and convenient way to shave. 12Practices that improve people's livesProviding customers with quality products that make every day better has driven our purpose for over 180 years. OUR FUTURE Ingredient Transparency We’re committed to continuing to be transparent about the ingredients we use (and don’t use) so that you can be confident when you add P&G products to your cart. See our fragrance ingredients list here. 2007 P&G in Your Neighborhood Tide Dry Cleaners launches in 2008 and is P&G’s big move into the service industry. It is quickly franchised across the country and in the first two years, serves over 500,000 customers, processes over 3.4 million garments, and creates over 150 jobs. 1941 Talking to Consumers We become one of the first companies to formally respond to consumer correspondence. By 1974, toll-free phone numbers allow consumers to contact us directly. By the 1990s, we incorporate email, and by the 2000s, social media makes connecting with consumers easier than ever. In 2011, we invent a listening solution which lets brands monitor what people are saying about their products in real-time. 1924 Start of Market Research D. Paul "Doc" Smelser, a Ph.D. economist from Johns Hopkins University, joins the team. He collects statistical data breaking out consumers by income and background, making us the first company to conduct deliberate, data-based market research with consumers. This allows us to improve consumer understanding and anticipate their needs to create products that improve everyday life. 12341890 First R&D Lab R&D quickly becomes a critical function at P&G and our first lab is added to the Ivorydale facility. By the 1920s, R&D is an integrated division of our company, employing a staff of several hundred young men and women. The Research Department develops ways to improve products, then passes their findings on to be translated into new manufacturing processes. 1887 Honest Business Ethics P&G products, known for their reputation for quality and being made by a company built on ethics, begin to be recognized through the slogan “Highest Grade, Honest Weight”. A retailer in Chicago, Illinois carries nothing but P&G products due to the demand for trusted products. 1886 An Industrial Masterpiece After a disastrous fire at our first plant, Ivorydale is purposefully built as a modern manufacturing facility. Designed by one of the nation's foremost industrial architects, Solon Beman, the new plant incorporates the latest designs for the safety and comfort of employees. We spend the next 130+ years expanding these manufacturing principles across the globe. 123A company that puts people firstWhat allows us to be one of the largest consumer goods company in the world is filling our buildings with passionate, inspired, motivated people who believe in doing better than good, every day. OUR FUTURE Diversity in Everything We Do We believe in diversity & inclusion. That’s why we support it however we can—from creating flexible work schedules for our employees to building inclusive playgrounds for children with and without disabilities. Learn more about our efforts. 2005 Women in Saudi Arabia We become the first consumer goods company to be granted a license to hire women in Saudi Arabia. Since then, our Saudi team has made significant progress in incorporating the talents and insights of women, while still respecting cultural norms and values. 1992 Women in Senior Positions The percentage of women filling senior management positions increases from 5% in 1992 to 30% in 2011. That same year, over 43% of new management hires from the past 5 years are women. 1992 LGBTQ+ Rights P&G includes sexual orientation in its Equal Employment Opportunity statement. The following year we support the creation of an internal grassroots organization known as GABLE and its efforts for LGBTQ+ inclusion within the company. 12341962 Diversity Programming Two years before the U.S. government mandates it, we initiate a diversity program for all employees—providing training and support to grow leaders regardless of sex, race, or religious orientation. 1905 Education Equality James N. Gamble helps establish what becomes the Bethune-Cookman University. This is just the beginning to the company’s long tradition of supporting historically black colleges and universities. 12Sustainable steps to a brighter futureA snapshot of all our sustainability achievements and efforts.

Learn more about our plan to address finite resources and growing consumption. 2016 World's 1st Beach Plastic Shampoo Bottle Head & Shoulders produces a bottle made from up to 25% recycled beach plastic—the first major step in establishing a unique supply chain involving thousands of volunteers and hundreds of NGOs. 2013 Making Zero Waste a Reality We announce during Earth Week that 45 P&G sites around the world have achieved zero-manufacturing-waste-to-landfill status, leading us to set bigger goals for 2030. 2005 Coldwater Technology 80-85% of energy used in the laundry process is used to heat water.

P&G corporate governanceStructure & Governance×Corporate Governance Overview At P&G, our Purpose, Values and Principles (PVPs) are the foundation of everything we do – this includes Corporate Governance. Corporate Governance is how the management, shareholders and Board of Directors ensure all investors—both shareholders and creditors—are protected against managers acting solely in their best interest. Our governance consists of laws, policies, procedures and practices that protect the well-being of P&G. The policies, procedures and practices in this section demonstrate how seriously we take corporate governance. Our management acts as long-term investors because they, like most P&G employees at all levels, are in fact long-term investors. Employees are long-term investors In 1887, before P&G was even a publicly traded company, William Cooper Procter introduced a profit-sharing program for employees. At the time, he said, “We should let the employees share in the firm’s earnings. That will give them an incentive to increase earnings.” He revised that program in 1903 to have the profit sharing be awarded in the form of actual P&G stock. He reasoned that as employees became stockholders, their economic interests and those of the Company would be bound more closely together. That program still exists today, with a large part of each U.S. employee’s retirement consisting of P&G stock. Additionally, virtually all employees own P&G stock or stock rights via various investment programs. Because of this, employees’ economic interests are aligned with the Company. Our Executive Share Ownership Program requires senior executives to own shares of company stock and/or restricted stock units valued at eight times base salary for the CEO, and five times base salary for the other senior executives. Non-employee directors must own company stock and/or restricted stock units worth six times their annual cash retainer. These compensation programs help to ensure the alignment of the interests of our senior executives and directors with shareholders. A foundation of integrity P&G has a strong history of operating with integrity throughout the company—at all levels, in all countries, both internally and externally. Our actions and the actions of all our employees are governed by our Purpose, Values and Principles. The basis for every decision we make at P&G can be found in our Purpose, Values and Principles—our PVPs. The clarity and constancy of the Company’s PVPs is the one factor above all others that has driven the Company’s growth over generations. Our commitment to operate responsibly is reflected in the steps we have in place to ensure rigorous financial discipline and Corporate Governance. We have an active, capable and diligent Board of Directors that meets the required standards of independence, with members who understand their role in providing strong Corporate Governance. Our Audit Committee is composed exclusively of independent directors with significant financial knowledge and experience. The Audit Committee also meets regularly in private session with the Company’s independent auditors, Deloitte & Touche LLP. We maintain a strong internal control environment. Our rigorous business process controls include written policies and procedures, segregation of duties and the careful selection and development of employees. The system is designed to provide reasonable assurance that transactions are executed as authorized and appropriately recorded, that assets are safeguarded and that accounting records are sufficiently reliable to permit the preparation of financial statements conforming in all material respects with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. We monitor these internal controls through an ongoing program of audit self-assessment and internal and external audits. We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed is recorded, processed, summarized and reported in a timely and accurate manner. Our Disclosure Committee is comprised of senior-level executives responsible for evaluating disclosure implications of significant business activities and events. We execute financial stewardship by maintaining specific programs and activities to ensure that employees understand their fiduciary responsibilities to shareholders. This ongoing effort encompasses financial discipline in strategic and daily business decisions and brings particular focus to maintaining accurate financial reporting and effective controls. In addition, our Global Leadership Council is actively involved in rigorous oversight of the business. We reinforce key employee responsibilities through the Company’s Worldwide Business Conduct, which details management’s and the Board of Directors’ commitment to conduct the Company’s business affairs with high ethical standards. Every employee is required to be trained on the Company’s Worldwide Business Conduct Manual, and every employee is held personally accountable for compliance. Portions of the Worldwide Business Conduct Manual comprise P&G’s Code of Ethics for SEC and New York Stock Exchange Regulatory Purposes, as further described in the Manual. Doing what's right Our reputation is earned by our conduct. What we say, what we do, the products we make, the services we provide and the way we act define us as a company. As conscientious citizens and employees, we only want to do what’s right. As a global leader, this is the only way to do business. BrandsWho we areCommunity impactSustainability

Sixth: The following provisions are hereby agreed to for the purpose of defining, limiting and regulating the exercise of the authority of the Company, or of its shareholders, or of any class of shareholders, or of its directors, or for the purpose of creating and defining rights and privileges of the shareholders among themselves: The Company may purchase, hold, sell and reissue any of its shares and to the extent that the authority to do the same may be granted under these Articles, the Board of Directors shall have power to do all said acts, without any action by shareholders, except as otherwise provided below in this Article Sixth. No holder of shares of any class shall have any right, pre-emptive or other, to subscribe for or to purchase from the Company any of the shares of any class of the Company hereafter issued or sold. (a) Except as otherwise provided in Subsection (b) of this Section 3 the following transactions shall require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least eighty percent (80%) of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote thereon, considered for the purposes of this Section 3 as one class: (i) the purchase by the Company of any of its shares of any class from any Related Person, if any such shares have been beneficially owned by the Related Person less than two years prior to the date of such purchase or any agreement in respect thereof; (ii) any merger or consolidation of the Company or a subsidiary of the Company with or into any Related Person, in each case without regard to which entity is the surviving entity; (iii) any sale, lease, exchange, transfer or other disposition of all or any substantial part of the assets of the Company or a subsidiary of the Company to or with any Related Person; (iv) the purchase by the Company from any Related Person of any assets or securities, or a combination thereof, except assets or securities or a combination thereof so acquired in a single transaction or a series of related transactions having an aggregate fair market value of less than Fifty Million Dollars ($50,000,000); (v) the issuance or transfer of any securities of the Company to any Related Person for cash; (vi) the adoption of any plan or proposal for the voluntary dissolution, liquidation, spin-off, or split-up of any kind of the Company or a subsidiary of the Company, or a recapitalization or reclassification of any securities of the Company, proposed by or on behalf of any Related Person; or (vii) any other material transaction involving the Company or a subsidiary of the Company with, or proposed by or on behalf of, any Related Person. Such affirmative vote shall be required notwithstanding the fact that no vote may be required, or that some lesser percentage may be specified, by law or in any agreement with any national securities exchange. (b) The provisions of this Section 3 shall not apply to any purchase described in Subsection (a)(i) of this Section 3 if the purchase would be made as part of any purchase by the Company of its shares made on the same terms to all holders of the shares to be purchased and complying with the applicable requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The provisions of this Section 3 shall also not apply to any transaction described in Subsection (a)(ii) through (vii) of this Section 3 if the Board of Directors of the Company shall by resolution have approved a memorandum of understanding with such Related Person with respect to and substantially consistent with such transaction prior to the time the Related Person became such, or if the transaction is approved by a resolution adopted by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the members of the whole Board of Directors of the Company at any time prior to the consummation thereof. (c) For the purposes of this Section 3, and as guidance to the Board of Directors for the purpose of Subsection (d) hereof, the term "Related Person" shall mean (1) any individual, firm, corporation or other entity, or group thereof acting or agreeing to act in the manner set forth in Rule 13d-5 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Act") as in effect on October 8, 1985, who is the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of five percent (5%) or more of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors and (2) any "Affiliate" or "Associate" of any of the above or of any entity or group (or any member thereof) described in Clause (1) above, whether or not acting as a Director of the Company. The terms "Affiliate" and "Associate" as used herein shall have the respective meanings ascribed to such terms in The General Rules and Regulations under the Act as in effect on October 8, 1985, and shall include any person otherwise acting in the capacity of an "Associate" or "Affiliate". The Term "Related Person" shall not include the Company, any subsidiary of the Company, any employee benefit plan of the Company or of a subsidiary of the Company, or any trustee of or fiduciary with respect to any such plan acting in such capacity. In addition to all shares beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, a Related Person shall also be deemed to be the beneficial owner of any shares of capital stock of the Company (1) which it has the right to acquire pursuant to any agreement, or upon exercise of conversion rights, warrants or options, or otherwise; or (2) which are beneficially owned, directly or indirectly (including shares deemed owned through application of Clause (1) above), (A) by its "Affiliate" or "Associate" or (B) by any other individual, firm, corporation, or other entity (or any "Affiliate" or "Associate" thereof) with which it or its "Affiliate" or "Associate" has any agreement, arrangement or understanding for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of capital stock of the Company. For the purposes of this Section 3, (A) the outstanding shares of any class of capital stock of the Company shall include shares deemed owned through the application of Clauses (1) and (2) of the preceding sentence but shall not include any other shares which may be issuable pursuant to any agreement, or upon exercise of conversion rights, warrants or options, or otherwise, and (B) subsidiary shall mean any corporation of which the Company owns, directly or indirectly, fifty percent (50%) or more of the voting stock. (d) The Board of Directors of the Company shall have the power and duty to determine for the purposes of this Section 3, on the basis of information then known to it, whether (1) any individual, firm, corporation, or other entity is a Related Person or is an "Affiliate" or an "Associate", or a group thereof; (2) any proposed sale, lease, exchange or other disposition of part of the assets of the Company or a subsidiary of the Company involves all or any substantial part of the assets of the Company or a subsidiary of the Company; (3) any assets or securities, or a combination thereof, to be acquired by the Company, have an aggregate fair market value of less than Fifty Million Dollars ($50,000,000) and whether the same are proposed to be acquired in a single transaction or a series of related transactions; (4) any plan or proposal is for the voluntary dissolution, liquidation, spin-off or split-up of any kind of the Company or a subsidiary of the Company, or is a recapitalization or reclassification of any securities of the Company, and whether any plan or proposal is proposed by or on behalf of any Related Person; (5) any transaction involving the Company or a subsidiary of the Company with, or proposed by or on behalf of any Related Person is material, and whether any such transaction is proposed by or on behalf of any Related Person; and (6) the memorandum of understanding referred to above is substantially consistent with the transaction to which it relates. (e) The Board of Directors of the Company, when evaluating any material, unsolicited offer of another party to (1) merge or consolidate the Company or a subsidiary of the Company with or into another corporation; (2) purchase or otherwise acquire all or any substantial part of the assets of the Company or a subsidiary of the Company; (3) sell any assets or securities to the Company; (4) purchase any securities from the Company or from the holders thereof in a tender offer; (5) dissolve, liquidate, spin off or split up the Company or a subsidiary of the Company, or to recapitalize or reclassify any securities of the Company; or (6) involve the Company or a subsidiary of the Company in any other material transaction, shall, in connection with the exercise of its judgment in determining what is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders, give due consideration to (A) all relevant factors, including without limitation the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the other party and the social, legal, environmental and economic effects on the employees, customers, suppliers and other affected persons, firms and corporations and on the communities and geographical areas in which the Company and its subsidiaries operate or are located and on any of the business and properties of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, as well as such other factors as the Directors deem relevant; and (B) the amount and form of the consideration being offered in relation to the then current market price for the Company's outstanding shares of capital stock, in relation to the then current value of the Company in a freely negotiated transaction or transactions and in relation to the Board of Directors' estimate of the future value of the Company (including the unrealized value of its properties and assets) as an independent concern. In evaluating any such offer, the Board of Directors shall be deemed to be performing their duly authorized duties and acting in good faith and in the best interests of the Company within the meaning of Section 1701.13 of the Ohio Revised Code, as it may be amended from time to time, and the Company's Regulations. The statutes of Ohio require that action on certain specified matters at a shareholders' meeting shall be taken by the affirmative vote of the holders of more than a majority of shares entitled to vote thereon, unless other provision is made in the Articles of Incorporation. On all these specified matters action may be taken by the affirmative vote of a majority of shares entitled to vote thereon or, if the vote is required to be by classes, by the affirmative vote of a majority of each class of shares entitled to vote thereon as a class, except that any amendment, alteration, addition to or repeal of this Article Sixth and of any of the matters specified above in Section 3 of this Article Sixth as requiring a vote other than the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote thereon, may only be taken, (1) prior to the date of the annual meeting in 1990, by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least eighty percent (80%) of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote thereon, considered for the purposes of this Section 4 as one class; (2) from the date of the annual meeting in 1990 to, and including the date of the annual meeting in 2000, by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote thereon, considered for the purposes of this Section 4 as one class, provided that during such period said vote may be increased at any time to the affirmative vote of the holders of at least eighty percent (80%) of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company by a resolution adopted by at least two-thirds (2/3) of the members of the whole Board of Directors³ (3) after the date of the annual meeting in 2000, by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote thereon, considered for the purposes of this Section 4 as one class. Seventh: No holder of shares of any class shall have the right to vote cumulatively in the election of Directors. Eighth: Each nominee for director shall be elected to the Board of Directors by a vote of the majority of the votes cast with respect to such nominee at any meeting of shareholders for the election of directors at which a quorum is present; provided, however, that if the number of nominees for directors exceeds the number of directors to be elected, the nominees receiving the greatest number of votes (up to the number of directors to be elected) shall be elected. For purposes of this provision, a majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted “for” a nominee must exceed the number of votes cast “against” that nominee. 3 On October 9, 1990, in accordance with this provision, the vote required was increased to 80% of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company.

APPENDIX A4 SERIES A ESOP CONVERTIBLE CLASS A PREFERRED STOCK (hereinafter referred to as Series A Preferred Stock) 1 Issuance and Cancellation. (A) All shares of Series A Preferred Stock redeemed or purchased by the Company shall be retired and shall be restored to the status of authorized but unissued shares of Class A Preferred Stock. (B) Shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be issued only to a trustee or trustees acting on behalf of an employee stock ownership trust or plan or other employee benefit plan of the Company. In the event of any transfer of shares of Series A Preferred Stock to any person other than any such plan trustee or trustees, the shares of Series A Preferred Stock so transferred, upon such transfer and without any further action by the Company or the holder, shall be automatically converted into shares of Common Stock on the terms otherwise provided for the conversion of shares of Series A Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 5 hereof and no such transferee shall have any of the voting powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional or special rights ascribed to shares of Series A Preferred Stock hereunder but, rather, only the powers and rights pertaining to the Common Stock into which such shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be so converted. Certificates representing shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be legended to reflect such restrictions on transfer. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 1, shares of Series A Preferred Stock (i) may be converted into shares of Common Stock as provided by Section 5 hereof and the shares of Common Stock issued upon such conversion may be transferred by the holder thereof as permitted by law and (ii) shall be redeemable by the Company upon the terms and conditions provided by Sections 6, 7 and 8 hereof. 2 Dividends and Distributions. (A) Subject to the provisions for adjustment hereinafter set forth, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, when and as declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available therefor, cash dividends ("Preferred Dividends") in an amount per share initially equal to $8.12⁴ per share per annum, subject to adjustment from time to time as hereinafter provided, (such amount, as adjusted from time to time, being hereinafter referred to as the "Preferred Dividend Rate"), payable quarterly, one-fourth on the third day of March, one-fourth on the third day of June, one-fourth on the third day of September, and one-fourth on the third day of December of each year (each a "Dividend Payment Date") commencing on June 3, 1989, to holders of record at the start of business on such Dividend Payment Date, provided that if the Board of Directors has declared since the prior Dividend Payment Date a quarterly dividend on the Common Stock at a rate that exceeds one-fourth of the Preferred Dividend Rate in effect on such day, the holders of record on the start of business on the record date for such dividend on the Common Stock shall be entitled to receive a cash dividend in an amount per share equal to the quarterly dividend declared on a share of Common Stock, payable on the same date as such dividend on the Common Stock, and provided further that the Dividend Payment Date for the Series A Preferred Stock shall thereafter be the same date as the record date for the dividend on the Common Stock or if no dividend is declared on the Common Stock in any quarter, the Dividend Payment Date shall be, as appropriate, the fifteenth day of February, May, August or November or if such days are not a day on which the New York Stock Exchange is open for business, then the next preceding day when the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Preferred Dividends shall begin to accrue on outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock from the date of issuance of such shares of Series A Preferred Stock. Preferred Dividends shall accrue on a daily basis, based on the Preferred Dividend Rate in effect on such day, whether or not the Company shall have earnings or surplus at the time, but Preferred Dividends accrued after March 3, 1989 on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock for any period less than a full quarterly period between Dividend Payment Dates shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of 30-day months. A full quarterly dividend payment of $2.034 per share shall accrue for the period from the date of issuance until June 3, 1989. Accumulated but unpaid Preferred Dividends shall cumulate as of the Dividend Payment Date on which they first become payable, but no interest shall accrue on accumulated but unpaid Preferred Dividends. 4 As a result of four two-for-one stock splits on the Common Stock effective October 20, 1989, May 15, 1992, August 22, 1997 and May 21, 2004, and the Smucker transaction effective June 1, 2002, the Conversion Price, Liquidation Price and Preferred Dividend Rate were all adjusted in accordance with the terms of paragraph 9(A)(1) of this Appendix A to be as follows: Conversion Price -- $6.82; Liquidation Price -- $6.82; Preferred Dividend Rate -- $.5036075 per share per annum, with a corresponding change in the quarterly dividend payment. (This footnote is not a part of the Company's Amended Articles of Incorporation but is included to provide up-to-date information on the status of Series A ESOP Convertible Class A Preferred Stock.) (B) (1) No full dividends shall be declared or paid or set apart for payment on any shares ranking, as to dividends, on a parity with or junior to the Series A Preferred Stock, for any period unless full cumulative dividends have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set apart for such payment on the Series A Preferred Stock for all Dividend Payment Dates occurring on or prior to the date of payment of such full dividends. When dividends are not paid in full, as aforesaid, upon the shares of Series A Preferred Stock and any other shares ranking, as to dividends, on a parity with Series A Preferred Stock, all dividends declared upon shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be declared pro rata so that the amount of dividends declared per share on Series A Preferred Stock and such other parity shares shall in all cases bear to each other the same ratio that accumulated dividends per share on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock and such other parity shares bear to each other. Except as otherwise provided in these Articles, holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to any dividends, whether payable in cash, property or shares, in excess of full cumulative dividends, as herein provided, on Series A Preferred Stock. (2) So long as any shares of Series A Preferred Stock are outstanding, no dividend (other than dividends or distributions paid in shares of, or options, warrants or rights to subscribe for or purchase shares of, Common Stock or other shares ranking junior to Series A Preferred Stock as to dividends and other than as provided in paragraph (B)(1) of this Section 2) shall be declared or paid or set aside for payment or other distribution declared or made upon the Common Stock or upon any other shares ranking junior to or on a parity with Series A Preferred Stock as to dividends, nor shall any Common Stock or any other shares of the Company ranking junior to or on a parity with Series A Preferred Stock as to dividends be redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired for any consideration (or any moneys be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any such shares) by the Company (except by conversion into or exchange for shares of the Company ranking junior to Series A Preferred Stock as to dividends) unless, in each case, the full cumulative dividends on all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall have been paid. (3) Any dividend payment made on shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall first be credited against the earliest accumulated but unpaid dividend due with respect to shares of Series A Preferred Stock. 3 Liquidation Preference. (A) In the event of any dissolution or liquidation of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, before any payment or distribution of the assets of the Company (whether capital or surplus) shall be made to or set apart for the holders of any series or class or classes of stock of the Company ranking junior to Series A Preferred Stock upon dissolution or liquidation, the holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive the Liquidation Price (as hereinafter defined) per share in effect at the time of dissolution or liquidation plus an amount equal to all dividends accrued (whether or not accumulated) and unpaid thereon to the date of final distribution to such holders; but such holders shall not be entitled to any further payments. The Liquidation Price per share which holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall receive upon dissolution or liquidation shall be $110.004, subject to adjustment as hereinafter provided. If, upon any dissolution or liquidation of the Company, the assets of the Company, or proceeds thereof, distributable among the holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall be insufficient to pay in full the preferential amount aforesaid and liquidating payments on any other shares ranking as to dissolution or liquidation, on a parity with Series A Preferred Stock, then such assets, or the proceeds thereof, shall be distributed among the holders of Series A Preferred Stock and any such other shares ratably in accordance with the respective amounts which would be payable on such shares of Series A Preferred Stock and any such other shares if all amounts payable thereon were paid in full. For the purposes of this Section 3, a consolidation or merger of the Company with one or more corporations shall not be deemed to be a dissolution or liquidation, voluntary or involuntary. (B) Subject to the rights of the holders of shares of any series or class or classes of stock ranking on a parity with or prior to Series A Preferred Stock upon dissolution or liquidation, upon any dissolution or liquidation of the Company, after payment shall have been made in full to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock as provided in this Section 3, but not prior thereto, any other series or class or classes of stock ranking junior to Series A Preferred Stock upon dissolution or liquidation shall, subject to the respective terms and provisions (if any) applying thereto, be entitled to receive any and all assets remaining to be paid or distributed, and the holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to share therein. 4 Ranking of Shares. Any shares of the Company shall be deemed to rank: (A) prior to Series A Preferred Stock as to dividends or as to distribution of assets upon dissolution or liquidation, if the holders of such class shall be entitled to the receipt of dividends or of amounts distributable upon dissolution or liquidation, as the case may be, in preference or priority to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock; (B) on a parity with Series A Preferred Stock as to dividends or as to distribution of assets upon dissolution or liquidation, whether or not the dividend rates, dividend payment dates, or redemption or liquidation prices per share thereof be different from those of Series A Preferred Stock, if the holders of such class of stock and Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to the receipt of dividends or of amounts distributable upon dissolution or liquidation, as the case may be, in proportion to their respective dividend or liquidation amounts, as the case may be, without preference or priority one over the other; and (C) junior to Series A Preferred Stock as to dividends or as to the distribution of assets upon dissolution or liquidation, if such shares shall be Common Stock or if the holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receipt of dividends or of amounts distributable upon dissolution or liquidation, as the case may be, in preference or priority to the holders of such shares. 5 Conversion into Common Stock. (A) A holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to cause any or all of such shares to be converted into shares of Common Stock. The number of shares of Common Stock into which each share of the Series A Preferred Stock may be converted shall be determined by dividing the Liquidation Price in effect at the time of conversion by the Conversion Price (as hereinafter defined) in effect at the time of conversion. The Conversion Price per share at which shares of Common Stock shall be initially issuable upon conversion of any shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be $110.004, subject to adjustment as hereinafter provided. (B) Any holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock desiring to convert such shares into shares of Common Stock shall surrender, if certificated, the certificate or certificates representing the shares of Series A Preferred Stock being converted, duly assigned or endorsed for transfer to the Company (or accompanied by duly executed stock powers relating thereto), or if uncertificated, a duly executed stock power relating thereto, at the principal executive office of the Company or the offices of the transfer agent for the Series A Preferred Stock or such office or offices in the continental United States or an agent for conversion as may from time to time be designated by notice to the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock by the Company or the transfer agent for the Series A Preferred Stock, accompanied by written notice of conversion. Such notice of conversion shall specify (i) the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be converted and the name or names in which such holder wishes the Common Stock and any shares of Series A Preferred Stock not to be so converted to be issued, and (ii) the address to which such holder wishes delivery to be made of a confirmation of such conversion, if uncertificated, or any new certificates which may be issued upon such conversion if certificated. (C) Upon surrender, if certificated, of a certificate representing a share or shares of Series A Preferred Stock for conversion, or if uncertificated, of a duly executed stock power relating thereto, the Company shall issue and send by hand delivery (with receipt to be acknowledged) or by first class mail, postage prepaid, to the holder thereof or to such holder's designee, at the address designated by such holder, if certificated, a certificate or certificates for, or if uncertificated, confirmation of, the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled upon conversion. In the event that there shall have been surrendered shares of Series A Preferred Stock, only part of which are to be converted, the Company shall issue and deliver to such holder or such holder's designee, if certificated, a new certificate or certificates representing the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock which shall not have been converted, or if uncertificated, confirmation of the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock which shall not have been converted. (D) The issuance by the Company of shares of Common Stock upon a conversion of shares of Series A Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock made at the option of the holder thereof shall be effective as of the earlier of (i) the delivery to such holder or such holder's designee of the certificates representing the shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion thereof if certificated or confirmation if uncertificated or (ii) the commencement of business on the second business day after the surrender of the certificate or certificates, if certificated, or a duly executed stock power, if uncertificated, for the shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be converted. On and after the effective date of conversion, the person or persons entitled to receive Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock, but no allowance or adjustment shall be made in respect of dividends payable to holders of Common Stock of record on any date prior to such effective date. The Company shall not be obligated to pay any dividends which shall have been declared and shall be payable to holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock on a Dividend Payment Date if such Dividend Payment Date for such dividend shall be on or subsequent to the effective date of conversion of such shares. (E) The Company shall not be obligated to deliver to holders of Series A Preferred Stock any fractional share or shares of Common Stock issuable upon any conversion of such shares of Series A Preferred Stock, but in lieu thereof may make a cash payment in respect thereof in any manner permitted by law. (F) The Company shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued Common Stock or treasury Common Stock, solely for issuance upon the conversion of shares of Series A Preferred Stock as herein provided, such number of shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be issuable upon the conversion of all the shares of Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding. 6 Redemption at the Option of the Company. (A) The Series A Preferred Stock shall be redeemable, in whole or in part, at the option of the Company at any time after March 3, 1994 (or on or before March 3, 1994 if permitted by, and at the redemption price provided in, paragraph (C) of this Section 6) at the following redemption prices per share: During the Twelve Month Period Beginning March 4, Price Per Share 1989 107.3750% of Series A Liquidation Price in effect on date fixed for redemption 1990 106.6375% of Series A Liquidation Price in effect on date fixed for redemption 1991 105.9000% of Series A Liquidation Price in effect on date fixed for redemption 1992 105.1625% of Series A Liquidation Price in effect on date fixed for redemption 1993 104.4250% of Series A Liquidation Price in effect on date fixed for redemption 1994 103.6875% of Series A Liquidation Price in effect on date fixed for redemption 1995 102.9000% of Series A Liquidation Price in effect on date fixed for redemption 1996 102.2125% of Series A Liquidation Price in effect on date fixed for redemption 1997 101.4750% of Series A Liquidation Price in effect on date fixed for redemption 1998 101.5750% of Series A Liquidation Price in effect on date fixed for redemption 1999 100.7875% of Series A Liquidation Price in effect on date fixed for redemption and thereafter at 100% of the Liquidation Price per share in effect on the date fixed for redemption, plus, in each case (including in the case of redemptions pursuant to paragraph (C) of this Section 6), an amount equal to all accrued (whether or not accumulated) and unpaid dividends thereon to the date fixed for redemption. Payment of the redemption price shall be made by the Company in cash or shares of Common Stock, or a combination thereof, as permitted by paragraph (D) of this Section 6. From and after the date fixed for redemption, dividends on shares of Series A Preferred Stock called for redemption will cease to accrue, such shares will no longer be deemed to be outstanding and all rights in respect of such shares of the Company shall cease, except the right to receive the redemption price. If less than all of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock are to be redeemed, the Company shall either redeem a portion of the shares of each holder determined pro rata based on the number of shares held by each holder or shall select the shares to be redeemed by lot, as may be determined by the Board of Directors of the Company. (B) Unless otherwise required by law, notice of redemption will be sent to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock at the address shown on the books of the Company or any transfer agent for Series A Preferred Stock by first class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not less than twenty (20) days nor more than sixty (60) days prior to the redemption date. Each notice shall state: (i) the redemption date; (ii) the total number of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed and, if fewer than all the shares held by such holder are to be redeemed, the number of such shares to be redeemed from such holder; (iii) the redemption price; (iv) the place or places where certificates, if certificated, for such shares are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price; (v) that dividends on the shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue on such redemption date; (vi) the conversion rights of the shares to be redeemed, the period within which conversion rights may be exercised, and the Conversion Price and number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of a share of Series A Preferred Stock at the time. Upon surrender of the certificates, if certificated, for any shares so called for redemption and not previously converted, or upon the date fixed for redemption if uncertificated, such shares shall be redeemed by the Company at the date fixed for redemption and at the redemption price set forth in this Section 6. (C) In the event of (i) a change in the federal tax law of the United States of America which has the effect of precluding the Company from claiming any of the tax deductions for dividends paid on the Series A Preferred Stock when such dividends are used as provided under Section 404(k)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended and in effect on the date shares of Series A Preferred Stock are initially issued, or (ii) The Procter & Gamble Profit Sharing Trust and Employee Stock Ownership Plan, as authorized by the Board of Directors of the Company on January 10, 1989, and as amended from time to time thereafter failing to receive a determination from the Internal Revenue Service that it is a qualified plan within the meaning of Section 401(a) or is an employee stock ownership plan as described in Section 4975(e)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and in effect on the date shares of Series A Preferred Stock are initially issued, then, in either such event, the Company may, in its sole discretion and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in paragraph (A) of this Section 6, elect to redeem such shares for the Liquidation Price in effect on the date fixed for redemption, plus, in each case, an amount equal to all accrued (whether or not accumulated) and unpaid dividends thereon to the date fixed for redemption. In the event the Company terminates the employee stock ownership plan of The Procter & Gamble Profit Sharing Trust and Employee Stock Ownership Plan, the Company may, in its sole discretion and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in paragraph (A) of this Section 6, elect to redeem such shares at the redemption prices per share provided in paragraph (A) of this Section 6. (D) The Company, at its option, may make payment of the redemption price required upon redemption of shares of Series A Preferred Stock in cash or in shares of Common Stock, or in a combination of such shares and cash, any such shares of Common Stock to be valued for such purpose at the average of the high and low reported sales price, or, in case no sale takes place on such day, the average reported closing bid and asked price, in either case as reported on the New York Stock Exchange Tape on the date of redemption, or if not listed or admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange, in accordance with the valuation methods provided in paragraph 9(F)(2). 7 Redemption at the Option of the Holder. Unless otherwise provided by law, shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be redeemed by the Company for cash or, if the Company so elects, in shares of Common Stock, or a combination of such shares and cash, any such shares of Common Stock to be valued for such purpose as provided by paragraph (D) of Section 6, at the Liquidation Price per share in effect on the date fixed for redemption plus all accrued (whether or not accumulated) and unpaid dividends thereon to the date fixed for redemption, at the option of the holder, at any time and from time to time upon notice to the Company given not less than five (5) business days prior to the date fixed by the holder in such notice for redemption, when and to the extent necessary for such holder to provide for distributions required to be made under, or to satisfy an investment election provided to participants in accordance with, The Procter & Gamble Profit Sharing Trust and Employee Stock Ownership Plan, as the same may be amended, or any successor plan (the "Plan"). 8 Consolidation, Merger, etc. (A) In the event that the Company shall consummate any consolidation or merger or similar transaction, however named, pursuant to which the outstanding shares of Common Stock are by operation of law exchanged solely for or changed, reclassified or converted solely into shares of any successor or resulting company (including the Company) that constitutes "qualifying employer securities" with respect to a holder of Series A Preferred Stock within the meanings of Section 4975(e)(8) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and Section 407(d)(5) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, or any successor provision of law, and, if applicable, for a cash payment in lieu of fractional shares, if any, then, in such event, the terms of such consolidation or merger or similar transaction shall provide that the shares of Series A Preferred Stock of such holder shall be substituted for and shall become preferred shares of such successor or resulting company, having in respect of such company insofar as possible the same powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights (including the redemption rights provided by Sections 6, 7, and 8 hereof), and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereon, that the Series A Preferred Stock had immediately prior to such transaction; provided, however, that after such transaction each share of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be convertible, pursuant to the terms and conditions provided by Section 5 hereof, into the qualifying employer securities so receivable by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Series A Preferred Stock could have been converted immediately prior to such transaction (provided that, if the kind or amount of qualifying employer securities receivable upon such transaction is not the same for each non-electing share, then the kind and amount of qualifying employer securities receivable upon such transaction for each non-electing share shall be the kind and amount so receivable per share by a plurality of the non-electing shares). The rights of the Series A Preferred Stock as preferred shares of such successor or resulting company shall successively be subject to adjustments pursuant to Section 9 hereof after any such transaction as nearly equivalent to the adjustments provided for by such section prior to such transaction. The Company shall not consummate any such merger, consolidation or similar transaction unless all the terms of this paragraph 8(A) are complied with. (B) In the event that the Company shall consummate any consolidation or merger or similar transaction, however named, pursuant to which the outstanding shares of Common Stock are by operation of law exchanged for or changed, reclassified or converted into other shares or securities or cash or any other property, or any combination thereof, other than any such consideration which is constituted solely of qualifying employer securities (as referred to in paragraph (A) of this Section 8) and cash payments, if applicable, in lieu of fractional shares, outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall, without any action on the part of the Company or any holder thereof (but subject to paragraph (C) of this Section 8), be deemed converted by virtue of such merger, consolidation or similar transaction immediately prior to such consummation into the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Series A Preferred Stock could have been converted at such time and each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall, by virtue of such transaction and on the same terms as apply to the holders of Common Stock, be converted into or exchanged for the aggregate amount of shares, securities, cash or other property (payable in like kind) receivable by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Series A Preferred Stock could have been converted immediately prior to such transaction if such holder of Common Stock failed to exercise any rights of election as to the kind or amount of shares, securities, cash or other property receivable upon such transaction (provided that, if the kind or amount of shares, securities, cash or other property receivable upon such transaction is not the same for each non-electing share, then the kind and amount of shares, securities, cash or other property receivable upon such transaction for each non-electing share shall be the kind and amount so receivable per share by a plurality of non-electing shares). (C) In the event the Company shall enter into any agreement providing for any consolidation or merger or similar transaction described in paragraph (B) of this Section 8, then the Company shall as soon as practicable thereafter (and in any event at least ten (10) business days before consummation of such transaction) give notice of such agreement and the material terms thereof to each holder of Series A Preferred Stock and each such holder shall have the right to elect, by written notice to the Company, to receive, upon consummation of such transaction (if and when such transaction is consummated), from the Company or the successor of the Company, in redemption and retirement of such Series A Preferred Stock, a cash payment equal to the Liquidation Price in effect on the date set for redemption plus all accrued (whether or not accumulated) and unpaid dividends. No such notice of redemption shall be effective unless given to the Company prior to the close of business on the fifth business day prior to consummation of such transaction, unless the Company or the successor of the Company shall waive such prior notice, but any notice of redemption so given prior to such time may be withdrawn by notice of withdrawal given to the Company prior to the close of business on the fifth business day prior to consummation of such transaction. 9 Anti-dilution Adjustments. A (1) Subject to the provisions of paragraph 9(D), in the event the Company shall, at any time or from time to time while any of the shares of the Series A Preferred Stock are outstanding, (i) pay a dividend or make a distribution in respect of the Common Stock in shares of Common Stock or (ii) subdivide or combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater or lesser number of shares, in each case whether by reclassification of shares, recapitalization of the Company (excluding a recapitalization or reclassification effected by a merger or consolidation to which Section 8 hereof applies) or otherwise, then, in such event, each share of Series A Preferred Stock will automatically, without any action on the part of the holder thereof or the Company, become that number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock (the "Non-dilutive Share Amount") equal to an amount which is a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately before such event. An adjustment pursuant to this paragraph 9(A)(1) shall be effective upon payment of such dividend or distribution in respect of the Common Stock and in the case of a subdivision or combination shall become effective immediately as of the effective date thereof. Concurrently with the automatic adjustment pursuant to this paragraph 9(A)(1), the Conversion Price, the Liquidation Price and the Preferred Dividend Rate of all shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by dividing the Conversion Price, the Liquidation Price and the Preferred Dividend Rate, respectively, in effect immediately before the event by the Non-dilutive Share Amount determined pursuant to this paragraph 9(A)(1). (2) The Company and the Board of Directors shall each use its best efforts to take all necessary steps or to take all actions as are necessary or appropriate for implementation of the automatic adjustment provided in paragraph 9(A)(1). In the event for any reason the Company is precluded from giving full effect to the automatic adjustment provided in paragraph 9(A)(1), then no such automatic adjustment shall occur, but instead the Conversion Price shall automatically be adjusted by dividing the Conversion Price in effect immediately before the event by the Non-dilutive Share Amount determined pursuant to paragraph 9(A)(1), and the Liquidation Price and the Preferred Dividend Rate will not be adjusted. An adjustment to the Conversion Price made pursuant to this paragraph 9(A)(2) shall be given effect, upon payment of such a dividend or distribution, as of the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution (on a retroactive basis) and in the case of a subdivision or combination shall become effective immediately as of the effective date thereof. If subsequently the Company is able to give full effect to the automatic adjustment as provided in paragraph 9(A)(1), then such automatic adjustment will proceed in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 9(A)(1) and the adjustment in the Conversion Price as provided in this paragraph 9(A)(2) will automatically be reversed and nullified prospectively. (B) (1) Subject to the provisions of paragraph 9(D), in the event the Company shall, at any time or from time to time while any of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock are outstanding, issue to holders of shares of Common Stock as a dividend or distribution, including by way of a reclassification of shares or a recapitalization of the Company, any right or warrant to purchase shares of Common Stock (but not including as such a right or warrant any security convertible into or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock) at a purchase price per share less than the Fair Market Value (as hereinafter defined) of a share of Common Stock on the date of issuance of such right or warrant, then, in such event, each share of Series A Preferred Stock will automatically, without any action on the part of the holder thereof or the Company, become that number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock (the "Non-dilutive Share Amount") equal to an amount which is a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately before such issuance of rights or warrants plus the maximum number of shares of Common Stock that could be acquired upon exercise in full of all such rights and warrants and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately before such issuance of rights or warrants plus the number of shares of Common Stock which could be purchased at the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock at the time of such issuance for the maximum aggregate consideration payable upon exercise in full of all such rights or warrants. Concurrently with the automatic adjustment pursuant to this paragraph 9(B)(1), the Conversion Price, the Liquidation Price and the Preferred Dividend Rate of all shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by dividing the Conversion Price, the Liquidation Price and the Preferred Dividend Rate, respectively, in effect immediately before such issuance of rights or warrants by the Non-dilutive Share Amount determined pursuant to this paragraph 9(B)(1). (2) The Company and the Board of Directors shall each use its best efforts to take all necessary steps or to take all actions as are necessary or appropriate for implementation of the automatic adjustment provided in paragraph 9(B)(1). In the event for any reason the Company is precluded from giving full effect to the automatic adjustment provided in paragraph 9(B)(1), then no such automatic adjustment shall occur, but instead the Conversion Price shall automatically be adjusted by dividing the Conversion Price in effect immediately before such issuance of rights or warrants by the Non-Dilutive Share Amount determined pursuant to paragraph 9(B)(1), and the Liquidation Price and Preferred Dividend Rate will not be adjusted. If subsequently the Company is able to give full effect to the automatic adjustment as provided in paragraph 9(B)(1), then such automatic adjustment will proceed in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 9(B)(1) and the adjustment in the Conversion Price as provided in this paragraph 9(B)(2) will automatically be reversed and nullified prospectively. (C) (1) Subject to the provisions of paragraph 9(D), in the event the Company shall, at any time or from time to time while any of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock are outstanding, make an Extraordinary Distribution (as hereinafter defined) in respect of the Common Stock, whether by dividend, distribution, reclassification of shares or recapitalization of the Company (including recapitalization or reclassification effected by a merger or consolidation to which Section 8 hereof does not apply) or effect a Pro Rata Repurchase (as hereinafter defined) of Common Stock, then, in such event, each share of Series A Preferred Stock will automatically, without any action on the part of the holder thereof or the Company, become that number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock (the "Non-dilutive Share Amount") equal to an amount which is a fraction the numerator of which is the product of (a) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately before such Extraordinary Distribution or Pro Rata Repurchase minus, in the case of a Pro Rata Repurchase, the number of shares of Common Stock repurchased by the Company multiplied by (b) the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the record date with respect to an Extraordinary Distribution or on the applicable expiration date (including all extensions thereof) of any tender offer which is a Pro Rata Repurchase or on the date of purchase with respect to any Pro Rata Repurchase which is not a tender offer, as the case may be, and the denominator of which is (i) the product of (x) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately before such Extraordinary Distribution or Pro Rata Repurchase multiplied by (y) the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the record date with respect to an Extraordinary Distribution, or on the applicable expiration date (including all extensions thereof) of any tender offer which is a Pro Rata Repurchase, or on the date of purchase with respect to any Pro Rata Repurchase which is not a tender offer, as the case may be, minus (ii) the Fair Market Value of the Extraordinary Distribution or the aggregate purchase price of the Pro Rata Repurchase, as the case may be. The Company shall send each holder of Series A Preferred Stock (i) notice of its intent to make any dividend or distribution and (ii) notice of any offer by the Company to make a Pro Rata Repurchase, in each case at the same time as, or as soon as practicable after, such offer is first communicated (including by announcement of a record date in accordance with the rules of any stock exchange on which the Common Stock is listed or admitted to trading) to holders of Common Stock. Such notice shall indicate the intended record date and the amount and nature of such dividend or distribution, or the number of shares subject to such offer for a Pro Rata Repurchase and the purchase price payable by the Company pursuant to such offer, as well as the Conversion Price and the number of shares of Common Stock into which a share of Series A Preferred Stock may be converted at such time. Concurrently with the automatic adjustment pursuant to this paragraph 9(C)(1), the Conversion Price, the Liquidation Price and the Preferred Dividend Rate of all shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by dividing the Conversion Price, the Liquidation Price and the Preferred Dividend Rate, respectively, in effect immediately before such Extraordinary Distribution or Pro Rata Repurchase by the Non-dilutive Share Amount determined pursuant to this paragraph 9(C)(1). (2) The Company and the Board of Directors shall each use its best efforts to take all necessary steps or to take all actions as are necessary or appropriate for implementation of the automatic adjustment provided in paragraph 9(C)(1). In the event for any reason the Company is precluded from giving full effect to the automatic adjustment provided in paragraph 9(C)(1), then no such automatic adjustment shall occur, but instead the Conversion Price shall automatically be adjusted by dividing the Conversion Price in effect immediately before such Extraordinary Distribution or Pro Rata Repurchase by the Non-dilutive Share Amount, and the Liquidation Price and the Preferred Dividend Rate will not be adjusted. If subsequently the Company is able to give full effect to the automatic adjustment as provided in paragraph 9(C)(1), then such automatic adjustment will proceed in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 9(C)(1) and the adjustment in the Conversion Price as provided in this paragraph 9(C)(2) will automatically be reversed and nullified prospectively. (D) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section 9, the Company shall not be required to make (i) any adjustment of the number of issued shares of Series A Preferred Stock, the Conversion Price, the Liquidation Price or the Preferred Dividend Rate unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least one percent (1%) in the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding, or, (ii) if no additional shares of Series A Preferred Stock are issued, any adjustment of the Conversion Price unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least one percent (1%) in the Conversion Price. Any lesser adjustment shall be carried forward and shall be made no later than the time of, and together with, the next subsequent adjustment which, together with any adjustment or adjustments so carried forward, shall amount to an increase or decrease of at least one percent (1%) of the number of Series A Preferred Shares outstanding or, if no additional shares of Series A Preferred Stock are being issued, an increase or decrease of at least one percent (1%) of the Conversion Price, whichever the case may be. (E) If the Company shall make any dividend or distribution on the Common Stock or issue any Common Stock, other capital stock or other security of the Company or any rights or warrants to purchase or acquire any such security, which transaction does not result in an appropriate adjustment to the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding or the Conversion Price pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 9, the Board of Directors of the Company may, in its sole discretion, consider whether such action is of such a nature that some type of equitable adjustment should be made in respect of such transaction. If in such case the Board of Directors of the Company determines that some type of adjustment should be made, an equitable adjustment not repugnant to law and for the protection of the conversion rights of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be made effective as of such date, as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company. The determination of the Board of Directors of the Company as to whether some type of adjustment should be made pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this paragraph 9(E), and, if so, as to what adjustment should be made and when, shall be final and binding on the Company and all shareholders of the Company. The Company shall be entitled to make such additional adjustments, in addition to those required by the foregoing provisions of this Section 9, as shall be necessary in order that any dividend or distribution in shares of capital stock of the Company, subdivision, reclassification or combination of shares of the Company or any recapitalization of the Company shall not be taxable to holders of the Common Stock. (F) For purposes of this Appendix A, the following definitions shall apply: (1) "Extraordinary Distribution" shall mean any dividend or other distribution (effected while any of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock are outstanding) of (i) cash, where the aggregate amount of such cash dividend or distribution together with the amount of all cash dividends and distributions made during the preceding period of twelve (12) months, when combined with the aggregate amount of all Pro Rata Repurchases [for this purpose, including only that portion of the aggregate purchase price of such Pro Rata Repurchase which is in excess of the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock repurchased as determined on the applicable expiration date (including all extensions thereof) of any tender offer or exchange offer which is a Pro Rata Repurchase, or the date of purchase with respect to any other Pro Rata Repurchase which is not a tender offer or exchange offer] made during such period, exceeds twelve and one-half percent (12½%) of the aggregate Fair Market Value of all shares of Common Stock outstanding on the record date for determining the shareholders entitled to receive such Extraordinary Distribution and (ii) any shares of capital stock of the Company (other than shares of Common Stock), other securities of the Company (other than securities of the type referred to in paragraph (B) of this Section 9), evidences of indebtedness of the Company or any other person or any other property (including shares of any subsidiary of the Company), or any combination thereof. The Fair Market Value of an Extraordinary Distribution for purposes of paragraph (C) of this Section 9 shall be the sum of the Fair Market Value of such Extraordinary Distribution plus the aggregate amount of any cash dividends or distributions which are not Extraordinary Distributions made during such twelve month period and not included in the calculation of any previous adjustment pursuant to paragraph (C) of this Section 9. (2) "Fair Market Value" shall mean, as to shares of Common Stock or any other class of capital stock or securities of the Company or any other issuer which are publicly traded, the average of the Current Market Prices (as hereinafter defined) of such shares or securities for each day of the Adjustment Period (as hereinafter defined). "Current Market Price" of publicly traded shares of Common Stock or any other class of capital stock or other security of the Company or any other issuer for a day shall mean the last reported sales price, regular way, or, in case no sale takes place on such day, the average reported closing bid and asked prices, regular way, in either case as reported on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Tape or, if such security is not listed or admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange, on the principal national securities exchange on which such security is listed or admitted to trading or, if not listed or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange, on the NASDAQ National Market System or, if such security is not quoted on such National Market System, the average of the closing bid and asked prices on each such day in the over-the-counter market as reported by NASDAQ or, if bid and asked prices for such security on each such day shall not have been reported through NASDAQ, the average of the bid and asked prices for such day as furnished by any New York Stock Exchange member firm regularly making a market in such security selected for such purpose by the Board of Directors of the Company on each trading day during the Adjustment Period. "Adjustment Period" shall mean the period of five (5) consecutive trading days, selected by the Board of Directors of the Company, during the twenty (20) trading days preceding, and including, the date as of which the Fair Market Value of a security is to be determined. The "Fair Market Value" of any security which is not publicly traded or of any other property shall mean the fair value thereof as determined by an independent investment banking or appraisal firm experienced in the valuation of such securities or property selected in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company, or, if no such investment banking or appraisal firm is in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company available to make such determination, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company. (3) "Pro Rata Repurchase" shall mean any purchase of shares of Common Stock by the Company or any subsidiary thereof, whether for cash, shares of capital stock of the Company, other securities of the Company, evidences of indebtedness of the Company or any other person or any other property (including shares of a subsidiary of the Company), or any combination thereof, effected while any of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock are outstanding, pursuant to any tender offer or exchange offer subject to Section 13(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or any successor provision of law, or pursuant to any other offer available to substantially all holders of Common Stock; provided, however, that no purchase of shares by the Company or any subsidiary thereof made in open market transactions shall be deemed a Pro Rata Repurchase. For purposes of this paragraph 9(F), shares shall be deemed to have been purchased by the Company or any subsidiary thereof "in open market transactions" if they have been purchased substantially in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 as in effect under the Exchange Act on the date shares of Series A Preferred Stock are initially issued by the Company or on such other terms and conditions as the Board of Directors of the Company shall have determined are reasonably designed to prevent such purchases from having a material effect on the trading market for the Common Stock. (G) Whenever an adjustment increasing the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding is required pursuant to this Appendix A, the Board of Directors shall take such action as is necessary so that a sufficient number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock are designated with respect to such increase resulting from such adjustment. Whenever an adjustment to the Conversion Price, the Liquidation Price or the Preferred Dividend Rate of the Series A Preferred Stock is required pursuant to this Appendix A, the Company shall forthwith place on file with the transfer agent for the Common Stock and the Series A Preferred Stock if there be one, and with the Treasurer of the Company, a statement signed by the Treasurer or Assistant Treasurer of the Company stating the adjusted Conversion Price, Liquidation Price and Preferred Dividend Rate determined as provided herein. Such statement shall set forth in reasonable detail such facts as shall be necessary to show the reason and the manner of computing such adjustment, including any determination of Fair Market Value involved in such computation. Promptly after each adjustment to the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding, the Conversion Price, the Liquidation Price or the Preferred Dividend Rate, the Company shall mail a notice thereof and of the then prevailing number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding, the Conversion Price, the Liquidation Price and the Preferred Dividend Rate to each holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock. 10 Miscellaneous. (A) All notices referred to herein shall be in writing, and all notices hereunder shall be deemed to have been given upon the earlier of receipt thereof or three (3) business days after the mailing thereof if sent by registered mail (unless first-class mail shall be specifically permitted for such notice under the terms of this Appendix A) with postage prepaid, addressed: (i) if to the Company, to its office at One Procter & Gamble Plaza, Cincinnati, Ohio 45202 (Attention: Treasurer) or to the transfer agent for the Series A Preferred Stock, or other agent of the Company designated as permitted by this Appendix A or (ii) if to any holder of the Series A Preferred Stock or Common Stock, as the case may be, to such holder at the address of such holder as listed in the stock record books of the Company (which may include the records of any transfer agent for the Series A Preferred Stock or Common Stock, as the case may be) or (iii) to such other address as the Company or any such holder, as the case may be, shall have designated by notice similarly given. (B) The term "Common Stock" as used in this Appendix A means the Company's Common Stock without par value, as the same exists at the date of filing of the Amendment to the Company's Amended Articles of Incorporation first designating Series A Preferred Stock, or any other class of stock resulting from successive changes or reclassifications of such Common Stock consisting solely of changes in par value, or from par value to without par value, or from without par value to par value. In the event that, at any time as a result of an adjustment made pursuant to Section 9 of this Appendix A, the holder of any share of the Series A Preferred Stock upon thereafter surrendering such shares for conversion shall become entitled to receive any shares or other securities of the Company other than shares of Common Stock, the anti-dilution provisions contained in Section 9 hereof shall apply in a manner and on terms as nearly equivalent as practicable to the provisions with respect to Common Stock, and the provisions of Sections 1 through 8 and 10 of this Appendix A with respect to the Common Stock shall apply on like or similar terms to any such other shares or securities. (C) The Company shall pay any and all stock transfer and documentary stamp taxes that may be payable in respect of any issuance or delivery of shares of Series A Preferred Stock or shares of Common Stock or other securities issued on account of Series A Preferred Stock pursuant hereto or certificates representing such shares or securities. The Company shall not, however, be required to pay any such tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance or delivery of shares of Series A Preferred Stock or Common Stock or other securities in a name other than that in which the shares of Series A Preferred Stock with respect to which such shares or other securities are issued or delivered were registered, or in respect of any payment to any person with respect to any such shares or securities other than a payment to the registered holder thereof, and shall not be required to make any such issuance, delivery or payment unless and until the person otherwise entitled to such issuance, delivery or payment has paid to the Company the amount of any such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of the Company, that such tax has been paid or is not payable. (D) In the event that a holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall not by written notice designate the name in which shares of Common Stock to be issued upon conversion of such shares should be registered or to whom payment upon redemption of shares of Series A Preferred Stock should be made or the address to which the certificate or certificates representing such shares, or such payment, should be sent, the Company shall be entitled to register such shares, and make such payment, in the name of the holder of such Series a Preferred Stock as shown on the records of the Company and to send the certificate or certificates or other documentation representing such shares, or such payment, to the address of such holder shown on the records of the Company. (E) The Company may appoint, and from time to time discharge and change, a transfer agent for the Series A Preferred Stock. Upon any such appointment or discharge of a transfer agent, the Company shall send notice thereof by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to each holder of record of Series A Preferred Stock. APPENDIX B5 SERIES B ESOP CONVERTIBLE CLASS A PREFERRED STOCK (hereinafter referred to as Series B Preferred Stock) 1 Cancellation. All shares of Series B Preferred Stock redeemed or purchased by the Company shall be retired and shall be restored to the status of authorized but unissued shares of Class A Preferred Stock. 2 Dividends and Distributions. (A) Subject to the provisions for adjustment hereinafter set forth, the holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, when and as declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available therefor, cash dividends ("Series B Preferred Dividends") in an amount per share initially equal to $4.125 per share per annum, subject to adjustment from time to time as hereinafter provided, (such amount, as adjusted from time to time, being hereinafter referred to as the "Series B Preferred Dividend Rate"), payable quarterly, one-fourth on the twenty-seventh day of November, one-fourth on the twenty-seventh day of February, one-fourth on the twenty-seventh day of May, and one-fourth on the twenty-seventh day of August of each year (each a "Series B Dividend Payment Date") commencing on August 27, 1993, to holders of record at the close of business on the second Friday of the relevant Series B Dividend Payment Date month, provided that if the Board of Directors has declared since the prior Dividend Payment Date a quarterly dividend on the Common Stock at a rate that exceeds one-fourth of the Preferred Dividend Rate in effect on such day, the holders of record on the start of business on the record date for such dividend on the Common Stock shall be entitled to receive a cash dividend in an amount per share equal to the quarterly dividend declared on a share of Common Stock, payable on the same date as such dividend on the Common Stock, and provided further that the Dividend Payment Date for the Series B Preferred Stock shall thereafter be the same date as the record date for the dividend on the Common Stock or if no dividend is declared on the Common Stock in any quarter, the Dividend Payment Date shall be, as appropriate, the fifteenth day of February, May, August or November or if such days are not a day on which the New York Stock Exchange is open for business, then the next preceding day when the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Series B Preferred Dividends shall begin to accrue on outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock from the date of issuance of such shares of Series B Preferred Stock. Series B Preferred Dividends shall accrue on a daily basis, based on the Series B Preferred Dividend Rate in effect on such day, whether or not the Company shall have earnings or surplus at the time, but Series B Preferred Dividends accrued after June 30, 1993 on the shares of Series B Preferred Stock for any period less than a full quarterly period between Series B Dividend Payment Dates shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of 30-day months. A partial dividend payment of $.64935⁵ per share shall accrue for the period from the date of issuance until August 27, 1993. Accumulated but unpaid Series B Preferred Dividends shall cumulate as of the Series B Dividend Payment Date on which they first become payable, but no interest shall accrue on accumulated but unpaid Series B Preferred Dividends. 5 As a result of two two-for-one stock splits on the Common Stock effective August 22, 1997 and May 21, 2004 and the Smucker transaction effective June 1, 2002, the Conversion Price, Liquidation Price and Preferred Dividend Rate were all adjusted in accordance with the terms of paragraph 9(A)(1) of this Appendix B to be as follows: Conversion Price -- $12.96; Liquidation Price -- $12.96; Preferred Dividend Rate -- $1.022 per share per annum, with a corresponding change in the quarterly dividend payment. (This footnote is not a part of the Company's Amended Articles of Incorporation but is included to provide up-to-date information on the status of Series B ESOP Convertible Class A Preferred Stock.)5 (B) (1) No full dividends shall be declared or paid or set apart for payment on any shares ranking, as to dividends, on a parity with or junior to the Series B Preferred Stock, for any period unless full cumulative dividends have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set apart for such payment on the Series B Preferred Stock for all Series B Dividend Payment Dates occurring on or prior to the date of payment of such full dividends. When dividends are not paid in full, as aforesaid, upon the shares of Series B Preferred Stock and any other shares ranking, as to dividends, on a parity with Series B Preferred Stock, all dividends declared upon shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall be declared pro rata so that the amount of dividends declared per share on Series B Preferred Stock and such other parity shares shall in all cases bear to each other the same ratio that accumulated dividends per share on the shares of Series B Preferred Stock and such other parity shares bear to each other. Except as otherwise provided in these Articles, holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to any dividends, whether payable in cash, property or shares, in excess of full cumulative dividends, as herein provided, on Series B Preferred Stock. (2) So long as any shares of Series B Preferred Stock are outstanding, no dividend (other than dividends or distributions paid in shares of, or options, warrants or rights to subscribe for or purchase shares of, Common Stock or other shares ranking junior to Series B Preferred Stock as to dividends and other than as provided in paragraph (B)(1) of this Section 2) shall be declared or paid or set aside for payment or other distribution declared or made upon the Common Stock or upon any other shares ranking junior to or on a parity with Series B Preferred Stock as to dividends, nor shall any Common Stock or any other shares of the Company ranking junior to or on a parity with Series B Preferred Stock as to dividends be redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired for any consideration (or any moneys be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any such shares) by the Company (except by conversion into or exchange for shares of the Company ranking junior to Series B Preferred Stock as to dividends) unless, in each case, the full cumulative dividends on all outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall have been paid. (3) Any dividend payment made on shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall first be credited against the earliest accumulated but unpaid dividend due with respect to shares of Series B Preferred Stock. 3 Liquidation Preference. (A) In the event of any dissolution or liquidation of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, before any payment or distribution of the assets of the Company (whether capital or surplus) shall be made to or set apart for the holders of any series or class or classes of stock of the Company ranking junior to Series B Preferred Stock upon dissolution or liquidation, the holders of Series B Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive the Series B Liquidation Price (as hereinafter defined) per share in effect at the time of dissolution or liquidation plus an amount equal to all dividends accrued (whether or not accumulated) and unpaid thereon to the date of final distribution to such holders; but such holders shall not be entitled to any further payments. The Series B Liquidation Price per share which holders of Series B Preferred Stock shall receive upon dissolution or liquidation shall be $52.245, subject to adjustment as hereinafter provided. If, upon any dissolution or liquidation of the Company, the assets of the Company, or proceeds thereof, distributable among the holders of Series B Preferred Stock shall be insufficient to pay in full the preferential amount aforesaid and liquidating payments on any other shares ranking as to dissolution or liquidation, on a parity with Series B Preferred Stock, then such assets, or the proceeds thereof, shall be distributed among the holders of Series B Preferred Stock and any such other shares ratably in accordance with the respective amounts which would be payable on such shares of Series B Preferred Stock and any such other shares if all amounts payable thereon were paid in full. For the purposes of this Section 3, a consolidation or merger of the Company with one or more corporations shall not be deemed to be a dissolution or liquidation, voluntary or involuntary. (B) Subject to the rights of the holders of shares of any series or class or classes of stock ranking on a parity with or prior to Series B Preferred Stock upon dissolution or liquidation, upon any dissolution or liquidation of the Company, after payment shall have been made in full to the holders of Series B Preferred Stock as provided in this Section 3, but not prior thereto, any other series or class or classes of stock ranking junior to Series B Preferred Stock upon dissolution or liquidation shall, subject to the respective terms and provisions (if any) applying thereto, be entitled to receive any and all assets remaining to be paid or distributed, and the holders of Series B Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to share therein. 4 Ranking of Shares. Any shares of the Company shall be deemed to rank: (A) prior to Series B Preferred Stock as to dividends or as to distribution of assets upon dissolution or liquidation, if the holders of such class shall be entitled to the receipt of dividends or of amounts distributable upon dissolution or liquidation, as the case may be, in preference or priority to the holders of Series B Preferred Stock; (B) on a parity with Series B Preferred Stock as to dividends or as to distribution of assets upon dissolution or liquidation, whether or not the dividend rates, dividend payment dates, or redemption or liquidation prices per share thereof be different from those of Series B Preferred Stock, if the holders of such class of stock and Series B Preferred Stock shall be entitled to the receipt of dividends or of amounts distributable upon dissolution or liquidation, as the case may be, in proportion to their respective dividend or liquidation amounts, as the case may be, without preference or priority one over the other; and (C) junior to Series B Preferred Stock as to dividends or as to the distribution of assets upon dissolution or liquidation, if such shares shall be Common Stock or if the holders of Series B Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receipt of dividends or of amounts distributable upon dissolution or liquidation, as the case may be, in preference or priority to the holders of such shares. 5 Conversion into Common Stock. (A) A holder of shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall be entitled to cause any or all of such shares to be converted into shares of Common Stock. The number of shares of Common Stock into which each share of the Series B Preferred Stock may be converted shall be determined by dividing the Series B Liquidation Price in effect at the time of conversion by the Series B Conversion Price (as hereinafter defined) in effect at the time of conversion. The Series B Conversion Price per share at which shares of Common Stock shall be initially issuable upon conversion of any shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall be $52.245, subject to adjustment as hereinafter provided. (B) Any holder of shares of Series B Preferred Stock desiring to convert such shares into shares of Common Stock shall surrender, if certificated, the certificate or certificates representing the shares of Series B Preferred Stock being converted, duly assigned or endorsed for transfer to the Company (or accompanied by duly executed stock powers relating thereto), or if uncertificated, a duly executed stock power relating thereto, at the principal executive office of the Company or the offices of the transfer agent for the Series B Preferred Stock or such office or offices in the continental United States or an agent for conversion as may from time to time be designated by notice to the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock by the Company or the transfer agent for the Series B Preferred Stock, accompanied by written notice of conversion. Such notice of conversion shall specify (i) the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock to be converted and the name or names in which such holder wishes the Common Stock and any shares of Series B Preferred Stock not to be so converted to be issued, and (ii) the address to which such holder wishes delivery to be made of a confirmation of such conversion, if uncertificated, or any new certificates which may be issued upon such conversion if certificated. (C) Upon surrender, if certificated, of a certificate representing a share or shares of Series B Preferred Stock for conversion, or if uncertificated, of a duly executed stock power relating thereto, the Company shall issue and send by hand delivery (with receipt to be acknowledged) or by first class mail, postage prepaid, to the holder thereof or to such holder's designee, at the address designated by such holder, if certificated, a certificate or certificates for, or if uncertificated, confirmation of, the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled upon conversion. In the event that there shall have been surrendered shares of Series B Preferred Stock, only part of which are to be converted, the Company shall issue and deliver to such holder or such holder's designee, if certificated, a new certificate or certificates representing the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock which shall not have been converted, or if uncertificated, confirmation of the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock which shall not have been converted. (D) The issuance by the Company of shares of Common Stock upon a conversion of shares of Series B Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock made at the option of the holder thereof shall be effective as of the earlier of (i) the delivery to such holder or such holder's designee of the certificates representing the shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion thereof if certificated or confirmation if uncertificated or (ii) the commencement of business on the second business day after the surrender of the certificate or certificates, if certificated, or a duly executed stock power, if uncertificated, for the shares of Series B Preferred Stock to be converted. On and after the effective date of conversion, the person or persons entitled to receive Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock, but no allowance or adjustment shall be made in respect of dividends payable to holders of Common Stock of record on any date prior to such effective date. The Company shall not be obligated to pay any dividends which shall have been declared and shall be payable to holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock on a Series B Dividend Payment Date if such Series B Dividend Payment Date for such dividend shall be on or subsequent to the effective date of conversion of such shares. (E) The Company shall not be obligated to deliver to holders of Series B Preferred Stock any fractional share or shares of Common Stock issuable upon any conversion of such shares of Series B Preferred Stock, but in lieu thereof may make a cash payment in respect thereof in any manner permitted by law. (F) The Company shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued Common Stock or treasury Common Stock, solely for issuance upon the conversion of shares of Series B Preferred Stock as herein provided, such number of shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be issuable upon the conversion of all the shares of Series B Preferred Stock then outstanding. 6 Redemption at the Option of the Company. (A) The Series B Preferred Stock shall be redeemable, in whole or in part, at the option of the Company at any time after November 27, 1995 (or on or before November 27, 1995 if permitted by, and at the redemption price provided in, paragraph (C) of this Section 6) at the following redemption prices per share: During the Twelve Month Period Beginning November 28, Price Per Share 1993 105.5125% of Series B Liquidation Price in effect on date fixed for redemption 1994 104.7250% of Series B Liquidation Price in effect on date fixed for redemption 1995 103.9375% of Series B Liquidation Price in effect on date fixed for redemption 1996 103.1500% of Series B Liquidation Price in effect on date fixed for redemption 1997 102.3625% of Series B Liquidation Price in effect on date fixed for redemption 1998 101.5750% of Series B Liquidation Price in effect on date fixed for redemption 1999 100.7875% of Series B Liquidation Price in effect on date fixed for redemption and thereafter at 100% of the Series B Liquidation Price per share in effect on the date fixed for redemption, plus, in each case (including in the case of redemptions pursuant to paragraph (C) of this Section 6), an amount equal to all accrued (whether or not accumulated) and unpaid dividends thereon to the date fixed for redemption. Payment of the redemption price shall be made by the Company in cash or shares of Common Stock, or a combination thereof, as permitted by paragraph (D) of this Section 6. From and after the date fixed for redemption, dividends on shares of Series B Preferred Stock called for redemption will cease to accrue, such shares will no longer be deemed to be outstanding and all rights in respect of such shares of the Company shall cease, except the right to receive the redemption price. If less than all of the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock are to be redeemed, the Company shall either redeem a portion of the shares of each holder determined pro rata based on the number of shares held by each holder or shall select the shares to be redeemed by lot, as may be determined by the Board of Directors of the Company. (B) Unless otherwise required by law, notice of redemption will be sent to the holders of Series B Preferred Stock at the address shown on the books of the Company or any transfer agent for Series B Preferred Stock by first class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not less than twenty (20) days nor more than sixty (60) days prior to the redemption date. Each notice shall state: (i) the redemption date; (ii) the total number of shares of the Series B Preferred Stock to be redeemed and, if fewer than all the shares held by such holder are to be redeemed, the number of such shares to be redeemed from such holder; (iii) the redemption price; (iv) the place or places where certificates, if certificated, for such shares are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price; (v) that dividends on the shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue on such redemption date; (vi) the conversion rights of the shares to be redeemed, the period within which conversion rights may be exercised, and the Series B Conversion Price and number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of a share of Series B Preferred Stock at the time. Upon surrender of the certificates, if certificated, for any shares so called for redemption and not previously converted, or upon the date fixed for redemption if uncertificated, such shares shall be redeemed by the Company at the date fixed for redemption and at the redemption price set forth in this Section 6. (C) In the event of (i) a change in the federal tax law of the United States of America which has the effect of precluding the Company from claiming any of the tax deductions for dividends paid on the Series B Preferred Stock when such dividends are used as provided under Section 404(k)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended and in effect on the date shares of Series B Preferred Stock are initially issued, or (ii) The Procter & Gamble Profit Sharing Trust and Employee Stock Ownership Plan, as authorized by the Board of Directors of the Company on May 7, 1990, and as amended from time to time thereafter failing to receive a determination from the Internal Revenue Service that it is a qualified plan within the meaning of Section 401(a) or is an employee stock ownership plan as described in Section 4975(e)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and in effect on the date shares of Series B Preferred Stock are initially issued, then, in either such event, the Company may, in its sole discretion and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in paragraph (A) of this Section 6, elect to redeem such shares for the Series B Liquidation Price in effect on the date fixed for redemption, plus, in each case, an amount equal to all accrued (whether or not accumulated) and unpaid dividends thereon to the date fixed for redemption. In the event the Company terminates the employee stock ownership plan of The Procter & Gamble Profit Sharing Trust and Employee Stock Ownership Plan or the portion thereof associated with retiree medical benefits, the Company may, in its sole discretion and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in paragraph (A) of this Section 6, elect to redeem such shares at the redemption prices per share provided in paragraph (A) of this Section 6. (D) The Company, at its option, may make payment of the redemption price required upon redemption of shares of Series B Preferred Stock in cash or in shares of Common Stock, or in a combination of such shares and cash, any such shares of Common Stock to be valued for such purpose at the average of the high and low reported sales price, or, in case no sale takes place on such day, the average reported closing bid and asked price, in either case as reported on the New York Stock Exchange Tape on the date of redemption, or if not listed or admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange, in accordance with the valuation methods provided in paragraph 9(F)(2). 7 Redemption to Satisfy Obligations of The Procter & Gamble Profit Sharing Trust and Employee Stock Ownership Plan. Unless otherwise provided by law, shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall be redeemed by the Company for cash or, if the Company so elects, in shares of Common Stock, or a combination of such shares and cash, any such shares of Common Stock to be valued for such purpose as provided by paragraph (D) of Section 6, at the Series B Liquidation Price per share in effect on the date fixed for redemption plus all accrued (whether or not accumulated) and unpaid dividends thereon to the date fixed for redemption, at the option of the holder, at any time and from time to time upon notice to the Company given not less than five (5) business days prior to the date fixed by the holder in such notice for redemption, when and to the extent necessary for such holder to provide for distributions required to be made under, or to satisfy an investment election provided to participants in accordance with, The Procter & Gamble Profit Sharing Trust and Employee Stock Ownership Plan, as the same may be amended, or any successor plan (the "Plan"). 8 Consolidation, Merger, etc. (A) In the event that the Company shall consummate any consolidation or merger or similar transaction, however named, pursuant to which the outstanding shares of Common Stock are by operation of law exchanged solely for or changed, reclassified or converted solely into shares of any successor or resulting company (including the Company) that constitutes "qualifying employer securities" with respect to a holder of Series B Preferred Stock within the meanings of Section 4975(e)(8) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and Section 407(d)(5) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, or any successor provision of law, and, if applicable, for a cash payment in lieu of fractional shares, if any, then, in such event, the terms of such consolidation or merger or similar transaction shall provide that the shares of Series B Preferred Stock of such holder shall be substituted for and shall become preferred shares of such successor or resulting company, having in respect of such company insofar as possible the same powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights (including the redemption rights provided by Sections 6, 7, and 8 hereof), and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereon, that the Series B Preferred Stock had immediately prior to such transaction; provided, however, that after such transaction each share of the Series B Preferred Stock shall be convertible, pursuant to the terms and conditions provided by Section 5 hereof, into the qualifying employer securities so receivable by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Series B Preferred Stock could have been converted immediately prior to such transaction (provided that, if the kind or amount of qualifying employer securities receivable upon such transaction is not the same for each non-electing share, then the kind and amount of qualifying employer securities receivable upon such transaction for each non-electing share shall be the kind and amount so receivable per share by a plurality of the non-electing shares). The rights of the Series B Preferred Stock as preferred shares of such successor or resulting company shall successively be subject to adjustments pursuant to Section 9 hereof after any such transaction as nearly equivalent to the adjustments provided for by such section prior to such transaction. The Company shall not consummate any such merger, consolidation or similar transaction unless all the terms of this paragraph 8(A) are complied with. (B) In the event that the Company shall consummate any consolidation or merger or similar transaction, however named, pursuant to which the outstanding shares of Common Stock are by operation of law exchanged for or changed, reclassified or converted into other shares or securities or cash or any other property, or any combination thereof, other than any such consideration which is constituted solely of qualifying employer securities (as referred to in paragraph (A) of this Section 8) and cash payments, if applicable, in lieu of fractional shares, outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall, without any action on the part of the Company or any holder thereof (but subject to paragraph (C) of this Section 8, be deemed converted by virtue of such merger, consolidation or similar transaction immediately prior to such consummation into the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Series B Preferred Stock could have been converted at such time and each share of Series B Preferred Stock shall, by virtue of such transaction and on the same terms as apply to the holders of Common Stock, be converted into or exchanged for the aggregate amount of shares, securities, cash or other property (payable in like kind) receivable by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Series B Preferred Stock could have been converted immediately prior to such transaction if such holder of Common Stock failed to exercise any rights of election as to the kind or amount of shares, securities, cash or other property receivable upon such transaction (provided that, if the kind or amount of shares, securities, cash or other property receivable upon such transaction is not the same for each non-electing share, then the kind and amount of shares, securities, cash or other property receivable upon such transaction for each non-electing share shall be the kind and amount so receivable per share by a plurality of non-electing shares). (C) In the event the Company shall enter into any agreement providing for any consolidation or merger or similar transaction described in paragraph (B) of this Section 8, then the Company shall as soon as practicable thereafter (and in any event at least ten (10) business days before consummation of such transaction) give notice of such agreement and the material terms thereof to each holder of Series B Preferred Stock and each such holder shall have the right to elect, by written notice to the Company, to receive, upon consummation of such transaction (if and when such transaction is consummated), from the Company or the successor of the Company, in redemption and retirement of such Series B Preferred Stock, a cash payment equal to the Series B Liquidation Price in effect on the date set for redemption plus all accrued (whether or not accumulated) and unpaid dividends. No such notice of redemption shall be effective unless given to the Company prior to the close of business on the fifth business day prior to consummation of such transaction, unless the Company or the successor of the Company shall waive such prior notice, but any notice of redemption so given prior to such time may be withdrawn by notice of withdrawal given to the Company prior to the close of business on the fifth business day prior to consummation of such transaction. 9 Anti-dilution Adjustments. (A) (1) Subject to the provisions of paragraph 9(D), in the event the Company shall, at any time or from time to time while any of the shares of the Series B Preferred Stock are outstanding, (i) pay a dividend or make a distribution in respect of the Common Stock in shares of Common Stock or (ii) subdivide or combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater or lesser number of shares, in each case whether by reclassification of shares, recapitalization of the Company (excluding a recapitalization or reclassification effected by a merger or consolidation to which Section 8 hereof applies) or otherwise, then, in such event, each share of Series B Preferred Stock will automatically, without any action on the part of the holder thereof or the Company, become that number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock (the "Non-dilutive Share Amount") equal to an amount which is a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately before such event. An adjustment pursuant to this paragraph 9(A)(1) shall be effective upon payment of such dividend or distribution in respect of the Common Stock and in the case of a subdivision or combination shall become effective immediately as of the effective date thereof. Concurrently with the automatic adjustment pursuant to this paragraph 9(A)(1), the Series B Conversion Price, the Series B Liquidation Price and the Series B Preferred Dividend Rate of all shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by dividing the Series B Conversion Price, the Series B Liquidation Price and the Series B Preferred Dividend Rate, respectively, in effect immediately before the event by the Non-dilutive Share Amount determined pursuant to this paragraph 9(A)(1). (2) The Company and the Board of Directors shall each use its best efforts to take all necessary steps or to take all actions as are necessary or appropriate for implementation of the automatic adjustment provided in paragraph 9(A)(1). In the event for any reason the Company is precluded from giving full effect to the automatic adjustment provided in paragraph 9(A)(1), then no such automatic adjustment shall occur, but instead the Series B Conversion Price shall automatically be adjusted by dividing the Series B Conversion Price in effect immediately before the event by the Non-dilutive Share Amount determined pursuant to paragraph 9(A)(1), and the Series B Liquidation Price and the Series B Preferred Dividend Rate will not be adjusted. An adjustment to the Series B Conversion Price made pursuant to this paragraph 9(A)(2) shall be given effect, upon payment of such a dividend or distribution, as of the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution (on a retroactive basis) and in the case of a subdivision or combination shall become effective immediately as of the effective date thereof. If subsequently the Company is able to give full effect to the automatic adjustment as provided in paragraph 9(A)(1), then such automatic adjustment will proceed in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 9(A)(1) and the adjustment in the Series B Conversion Price as provided in this paragraph 9(A)(2) will automatically be reversed and nullified prospectively. (B) (1) Subject to the provisions of paragraph 9(D), in the event the Company shall, at any time or from time to time while any of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock are outstanding, issue to holders of shares of Common Stock as a dividend or distribution, including by way of a reclassification of shares or a recapitalization of the Company, any right or warrant to purchase shares of Common Stock (but not including as such a right or warrant any security convertible into or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock) at a purchase price per share less than the Fair Market Value (as hereinafter defined) of a share of Common Stock on the date of issuance of such right or warrant, then, in such event, each share of Series B Preferred Stock will automatically, without any action on the part of the holder thereof or the Company, become that number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock (the "Non-dilutive Share Amount") equal to an amount which is a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately before such issuance of rights or warrants plus the maximum number of shares of Common Stock that could be acquired upon exercise in full of all such rights and warrants and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately before such issuance of rights or warrants plus the number of shares of Common Stock which could be purchased at the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock at the time of such issuance for the maximum aggregate consideration payable upon exercise in full of all such rights or warrants. Concurrently with the automatic adjustment pursuant to this paragraph 9(B)(1), the Series B Conversion Price, the Series B Liquidation Price and the Series B Preferred Dividend Rate of all shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by dividing the Series B Conversion Price, the Series B Liquidation Price and the Series B Preferred Dividend Rate, respectively, in effect immediately before such issuance of rights or warrants by the Non-dilutive Share Amount determined pursuant to this paragraph 9(B)(1). (2) The Company and the Board of Directors shall each use its best efforts to take all necessary steps or to take all actions as are necessary or appropriate for implementation of the automatic adjustment provided in paragraph 9(B)(1). In the event for any reason the Company is precluded from giving full effect to the automatic adjustment provided in paragraph 9(B)(1), then no such automatic adjustment shall occur, but instead the Series B Conversion Price shall automatically be adjusted by dividing the Series B Conversion Price in effect immediately before such issuance of rights or warrants by the Non-Dilutive Share Amount determined pursuant to paragraph 9(B)(1), and the Series B Liquidation Price and Series B Preferred Dividend Rate will not be adjusted. If subsequently the Company is able to give full effect to the automatic adjustment as provided in paragraph 9(B)(1), then such automatic adjustment will proceed in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 9(B)(1) and the adjustment in the Series B Conversion Price as provided in this paragraph 9(B)(2) will automatically be reversed and nullified prospectively. (C) (1) Subject to the provisions of paragraph 9(D), in the event the Company shall, at any time or from time to time while any of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock are outstanding, make an Extraordinary Distribution (as hereinafter defined) in respect of the Common Stock, whether by dividend, distribution, reclassification of shares or recapitalization of the Company (including recapitalization or reclassification effected by a merger or consolidation to which Section 8 hereof does not apply) or effect a Pro Rata Repurchase (as hereinafter defined) of Common Stock, then, in such event, each share of Series B Preferred Stock will automatically, without any action on the part of the holder thereof or the Company, become that number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock (the "Non-dilutive Share Amount") equal to an amount which is a fraction the numerator of which is the product of (a) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately before such Extraordinary Distribution or Pro Rata Repurchase minus, in the case of a Pro Rata Repurchase, the number of shares of Common Stock repurchased by the Company multiplied by (b) the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the record date with respect to an Extraordinary Distribution or on the applicable expiration date (including all extensions thereof) of any tender offer which is a Pro Rata Repurchase or on the date of purchase with respect to any Pro Rata Repurchase which is not a tender offer, as the case may be, and the denominator of which is (i) the product of (x) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately before such Extraordinary Distribution or Pro Rata Repurchase multiplied by (y) the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the record date with respect to an Extraordinary Distribution, or on the applicable expiration date (including all extensions thereof) of any tender offer which is a Pro Rata Repurchase, or on the date of purchase with respect to any Pro Rata Repurchase which is not a tender offer, as the case may be, minus (ii) the Fair Market Value of the Extraordinary Distribution or the aggregate purchase price of the Pro Rata Repurchase, as the case may be. The Company shall send each holder of Series B Preferred Stock (i) notice of its intent to make any dividend or distribution and (ii) notice of any offer by the Company to make a Pro Rata Repurchase, in each case at the same time as, or as soon as practicable after, such offer is first communicated (including by announcement of a record date in accordance with the rules of any stock exchange on which the Common Stock is listed or admitted to trading) to holders of Common Stock. Such notice shall indicate the intended record date and the amount and nature of such dividend or distribution, or the number of shares subject to such offer for a Pro Rata Repurchase and the purchase price payable by the Company pursuant to such offer, as well as the Series B Conversion Price and the number of shares of Common Stock into which a share of Series B Preferred Stock may be converted at such time. Concurrently with the automatic adjustment pursuant to this paragraph 9(C)(1), the Series B Conversion Price, the Series B Liquidation Price and the Series B Preferred Dividend Rate of all shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by dividing the Series B Conversion Price, the Series B Liquidation Price and the Series B Preferred Dividend Rate, respectively, in effect immediately before such Extraordinary Distribution or Pro Rata Repurchase by the Non-dilutive Share Amount determined pursuant to this paragraph 9(C)(1). (2) The Company and the Board of Directors shall each use its best efforts to take all necessary steps or to take all actions as are necessary or appropriate for implementation of the automatic adjustment provided in paragraph 9(C)(1). In the event for any reason the Company is precluded from giving full effect to the automatic adjustment provided in paragraph 9(C)(1), then no such automatic adjustment shall occur, but instead the Series B Conversion Price shall automatically be adjusted by dividing the Series B Conversion Price in effect immediately before such Extraordinary Distribution or Pro Rata Repurchase by the Non-dilutive Share Amount, and the Series B Liquidation Price and the Series B Preferred Dividend Rate will not be adjusted. If subsequently the Company is able to give full effect to the automatic adjustment as provided in paragraph 9(C)(1), then such automatic adjustment will proceed in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 9(C)(1) and the adjustment in the Series B Conversion Price as provided in this paragraph 9(C)(2) will automatically be reversed and nullified prospectively. (D) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section 9, the Company shall not be required to make (i) any adjustment of the number of issued shares of Series B Preferred Stock, the Series B Conversion Price, the Series B Liquidation Price or the Series B Preferred Dividend Rate unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least one percent (1%) in the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock outstanding, or, (ii) if no additional shares of Series B Preferred Stock are issued, any adjustment of the Series B Conversion Price unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least one percent (1%) in the Series B Conversion Price. Any lesser adjustment shall be carried forward and shall be made no later than the time of, and together with, the next subsequent adjustment which, together with any adjustment or adjustments so carried forward, shall amount to an increase or decrease of at least one percent (1%) of the number of Series B Preferred Shares outstanding or, if no additional shares of Series B Preferred Stock are being issued, an increase or decrease of at least one percent (1%) of the Series B Conversion Price, whichever the case may be. (E) If the Company shall make any dividend or distribution on the Common Stock or issue any Common Stock, other capital stock or other security of the Company or any rights or warrants to purchase or acquire any such security, which transaction does not result in an appropriate adjustment to the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock outstanding or the Series B Conversion Price pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 9, the Board of Directors of the Company may, in its sole discretion, consider whether such action is of such a nature that some type of equitable adjustment should be made in respect of such transaction. If in such case the Board of Directors of the Company determines that some type of adjustment should be made, an equitable adjustment not repugnant to law and for the protection of the conversion rights of the Series B Preferred Stock shall be made effective as of such date, as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company. The determination of the Board of Directors of the Company as to whether some type of adjustment should be made pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this paragraph 9(E), and, if so, as to what adjustment should be made and when, shall be final and binding on the Company and all shareholders of the Company. The Company shall be entitled to make such additional adjustments, in addition to those required by the foregoing provisions of this Section 9, as shall be necessary in order that any dividend or distribution in shares of capital stock of the Company, subdivision, reclassification or combination of shares of the Company or any recapitalization of the Company shall not be taxable to holders of the Common Stock. (F) For purposes of this Appendix B, the following definitions shall apply: (1) "Extraordinary Distribution" shall mean any dividend or other distribution (effected while any of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock are outstanding) of (i) cash, where the aggregate amount of such cash dividend or distribution together with the amount of all cash dividends and distributions made during the preceding period of twelve (12) months, when combined with the aggregate amount of all Pro Rata Repurchases [for this purpose, including only that portion of the aggregate purchase price of such Pro Rata Repurchase which is in excess of the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock repurchased as determined on the applicable expiration date (including all extensions thereof) of any tender offer or exchange offer which is a Pro Rata Repurchase, or the date of purchase with respect to any other Pro Rata Repurchase which is not a tender offer or exchange offer] made during such period, exceeds twelve and one-half percent (12½%) of the aggregate Fair Market Value of all shares of Common Stock outstanding on the record date for determining the shareholders entitled to receive such Extraordinary Distribution and (ii) any shares of capital stock of the Company (other than shares of Common Stock), other securities of the Company (other than securities of the type referred to in paragraph (B) of this Section 9), evidences of indebtedness of the Company or any other person or any other property (including shares of any subsidiary of the Company), or any combination thereof. The Fair Market Value of an Extraordinary Distribution for purposes of paragraph (C) of this Section 9 shall be the sum of the Fair Market Value of such Extraordinary Distribution plus the aggregate amount of any cash dividends or distributions which are not Extraordinary Distributions made during such twelve month period and not included in the calculation of any previous adjustment pursuant to paragraph (C) of this Section 9. (2) "Fair Market Value" shall mean, as to shares of Common Stock or any other class of capital stock or securities of the Company or any other issuer which are publicly traded, the average of the Current Market Prices (as hereinafter defined) of such shares or securities for each day of the Adjustment Period (as hereinafter defined). "Current Market Price" of publicly traded shares of Common Stock or any other class of capital stock or other security of the Company or any other issuer for a day shall mean the last reported sales price, regular way, or, in case no sale takes place on such day, the average reported closing bid and asked prices, regular way, in either case as reported on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Tape or, if such security is not listed or admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange, on the principal national securities exchange on which such security is listed or admitted to trading or, if not listed or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange, on the NASDAQ National Market System or, if such security is not quoted on such National Market System, the average of the closing bid and asked prices on each such day in the over-the-counter market as reported by NASDAQ or, if bid and asked prices for such security on each such day shall not have been reported through NASDAQ, the average of the bid and asked prices for such day as furnished by any New York Stock Exchange member firm regularly making a market in such security selected for such purpose by the Board of Directors of the Company on each trading day during the Adjustment Period. "Adjustment Period" shall mean the period of five (5) consecutive trading days, selected by the Board of Directors of the Company, during the twenty (20) trading days preceding, and including, the date as of which the Fair Market Value of a security is to be determined. The "Fair Market Value" of any security which is not publicly traded or of any other property shall mean the fair value thereof as determined by an independent investment banking or appraisal firm experienced in the valuation of such securities or property selected in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company, or, if no such investment banking or appraisal firm is in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company available to make such determination, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company. (3) "Pro Rata Repurchase" shall mean any purchase of shares of Common Stock by the Company or any subsidiary thereof, whether for cash, shares of capital stock of the Company, other securities of the Company, evidences of indebtedness of the Company or any other person or any other property (including shares of a subsidiary of the Company), or any combination thereof, effected while any of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock are outstanding, pursuant to any tender offer or exchange offer subject to Section 13(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or any successor provision of law, or pursuant to any other offer available to substantially all holders of Common Stock; provided, however, that no purchase of shares by the Company or any subsidiary thereof made in open market transactions shall be deemed a Pro Rata Repurchase. For purposes of this paragraph 9(F), shares shall be deemed to have been purchased by the Company or any subsidiary thereof "in open market transactions" if they have been purchased substantially in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 as in effect under the Exchange Act on the date shares of Series B Preferred Stock are initially issued by the Company or on such other terms and conditions as the Board of Directors of the Company shall have determined are reasonably designed to prevent such purchases from having a material effect on the trading market for the Common Stock. (G) Whenever an adjustment increasing the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock outstanding is required pursuant to this Appendix B, the Board of Directors shall take such action as is necessary so that a sufficient number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock are designated with respect to such increase resulting from such adjustment. Whenever an adjustment to the Series B Conversion Price, the Series B Liquidation Price or the Series B Preferred Dividend Rate of the Series B Preferred Stock is required pursuant to this Appendix B, the Company shall forthwith place on file with the transfer agent for the Common Stock and the Series B Preferred Stock if there be one, and with the Treasurer of the Company, a statement signed by the Treasurer or Assistant Treasurer of the Company stating the adjusted Series B Conversion Price, Series B Liquidation Price and Series B Preferred Dividend Rate determined as provided herein. Such statement shall set forth in reasonable detail such facts as shall be necessary to show the reason and the manner of computing such adjustment, including any determination of Fair Market Value involved in such computation. Promptly after each adjustment to the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock outstanding, the Series B Conversion Price, the Series B Liquidation Price or the Series B Preferred Dividend Rate, the Company shall mail a notice thereof and of the then prevailing number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock outstanding, the Series B Conversion Price, the Series B Liquidation Price and the Series B Preferred Dividend Rate to each holder of shares of Series B Preferred Stock. 10 Miscellaneous. (A) All notices referred to herein shall be in writing, and all notices hereunder shall be deemed to have been given upon the earlier of receipt thereof or three (3) business days after the mailing thereof if sent by registered mail (unless first-class mail shall be specifically permitted for such notice under the terms of this Appendix B) with postage prepaid, addressed: (i) if to the Company, to its office at One Procter & Gamble Plaza, Cincinnati, Ohio 45202 (Attention: Treasurer) or to the transfer agent for the Series B Preferred Stock, or other agent of the Company designated as permitted by this Appendix B or (ii) if to any holder of the Series B Preferred Stock or Common Stock, as the case may be, to such holder at the address of such holder as listed in the stock record books of the Company (which may include the records of any transfer agent for the Series B Preferred Stock or Common Stock, as the case may be) or (iii) to such other address as the Company or any such holder, as the case may be, shall have designated by notice similarly given. (B) The term "Common Stock" as used in this Appendix B means the Company's Common Stock without par value, as the same exists at the date of filing of the Amendment to the Company's Amended Articles of Incorporation first designating Series B Preferred Stock, or any other class of stock resulting from successive changes or reclassifications of such Common Stock consisting solely of changes in par value, or from par value to without par value, or from without par value to par value. In the event that, at any time as a result of an adjustment made pursuant to Section 9 of this Appendix B, the holder of any share of the Series B Preferred Stock upon thereafter surrendering such shares for conversion shall become entitled to receive any shares or other securities of the Company other than shares of Common Stock, the anti-dilution provisions contained in Section 9 hereof shall apply in a manner and on terms as nearly equivalent as practicable to the provisions with respect to Common Stock, and the provisions of Sections 1 through 8 and 10 of this Appendix B with respect to the Common Stock shall apply on like or similar terms to any such other shares or securities. (C) The Company shall pay any and all stock transfer and documentary stamp taxes that may be payable in respect of any issuance or delivery of shares of Series B Preferred Stock or shares of Common Stock or other securities issued on account of Series B Preferred Stock pursuant hereto or certificates representing such shares or securities. The Company shall not, however, be required to pay any such tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer of the Series B Preferred or Common Stock or other Securities by the holder thereof to a subsequent holder resulting in the issuance or delivery of shares of Series B Preferred Stock or Common Stock or other securities in a name other than that in which the shares of Series B Preferred Stock with respect to which such shares or other securities are issued or delivered were registered, or in respect of any payment to any person with respect to any such shares or securities other than a payment to the registered holder thereof, and shall not be required to make any such issuance, delivery or payment unless and until the person otherwise entitled to such issuance, delivery or payment has paid to the Company the amount of any such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of the Company, that such tax has been paid or is not payable. (D) In the event that a holder of shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall not by written notice designate the name in which shares of Common Stock to be issued upon conversion of such shares should be registered or to whom payment upon redemption of shares of Series B Preferred Stock should be made or the address to which the certificate or certificates representing such shares, or such payment, should be sent, the Company shall be entitled to register such shares, and make such payment, in the name of the holder of such Series B Preferred Stock as shown on the records of the Company and to send the certificate or certificates or other documentation representing such shares, or such payment, to the address of such holder shown on the records of the Company. (E) The Company may appoint, and from time to time discharge and change, a transfer agent for the Series B Preferred Stock.

P&G History - A legacy of forward-thinkingP&G History.A legacy of forward-thinkingFor more than 185 years, we’ve challenged the norm and inspired the future—from the products we put on the shelf to the people we bring on our team. Click a category to explore the events that made us who we are today. Click to jump to each section. Serendipitous momentsSocial effortsInnovative productsRevolutionary techEveryday practicesPutting people firstSustainable effortsMoments of brillianceSerendipitous strokes of genius and passion-fueled ideas launched iconic brands and defined us as a company. OUR FUTURE Open Call for Ideas Our Connect + Develop program helps us partner with innovators around the world to solve problems for our consumers’ needs. Learn more. 2000 A Food Wrap That Whitens Teeth: Glad Press’n Seal & Crest Whitestrips To combat plastic wrap that loses its grip, P&G develops a technology to create Glad Press’n Seal. At the same time, a young employee working on at-home teeth whitening products connects with his mentor who shares a prototype of the food wrap with him. Sparked by this new idea, they cut the wrap into small strips, and apply it to their teeth. Shortly after, Crest Whitestrips is developed. 1998 One Insight That Led to Easier Cleaning for All: Always & Swiffer Wet Jet A consumer explained to a Products Researcher that while she liked Mr. Clean liquid, it didn’t make the cleaning process any easier. She opened her broom closet—full of mops, brushes, and buckets—and asked him to clean that up. Our researchers combine our capabilities in highly absorbent non-wovens, like the ones used in Always and Pampers, with our cleaner solutions expertise, creating both the Swiffer Wet Jet and the Quick Clean category. 1973 A Softener for the Dryer: Bounce With the addition of dryers in homes, static cling becomes a key issue. P&G finds a new way to deliver fabric softener via a towel. Research quickly led us to an inventor who had already figured it out, and we acquired the technology. Bounce dryer sheets are introduced as a fresh alternative to liquid fabric softeners. 12341961 A Grandfather Inspired by His Grandson: Pampers While watching his first grandchild, a P&G researcher quickly realizes the mess of cloth diapers and the need to carry them until returning home. This leads him and fellow researchers to develop a better & more affordable disposable diaper. Since then, Pampers has continuously advanced—moving from pins to tapes, becoming thinner and more cloth-like, and designed for babies at every stage of development. 1894 A Father's Concern: VapoRub A pharmacist developed several home remedies, such as cough syrups and other liquids that he sold in his local store. One day his infant son became ill. Unsure any of the ingestible products would be effective, he creates an externally-applied salve that releases cough-soothing vapors when heated by the body. His son’s health improves, and generations around the world grow up with VapoRub. 12A corporate force for goodOur employees have been the driving force behind our support for our environment, communities, and people—a practice that has been ingrained in our culture for over a century. OUR FUTURE Building Our Impact Each year, we actively continue to integrate Citizenship into how we do business. The more we do that, the bigger the impact we can make with the people we serve, the communities where we live and work, and the broader world that surrounds us. See what we’re up to now. 2015 Always’ #LikeAGirl The 2015 Super Bowl’s most-liked commercial changes the conversation about girls and sports, taking an unintentionally derogatory phrase and making it one of empowerment, strength, and pride. Millions of girls around the world rally to change #LikeAGirl to mean amazing things. This massive engagement starts to change public perception: while only 19% of girls had a positive association with the phrase “like a girl” before the campaign, 76% agree they no longer view the phrase as an insult after watching the Always #LikeAGirl film. 2012 Summer Olympics Campaign After the success of our 2010 “Proud Sponsor of Moms” campaign, we launch “Thank You, Mom"—a campaign where we support 150 global athletes and their Moms. When asked in what way we can help them most, Moms respond that they'd like to see us support youth sports. For this reason, we commit to raising $25 million globally. 2012 Honored in the Community The United Way—a non-profit organization that fights for health, education, and financial stability—celebrates its 125th Anniversary and awards us with The Spirit of America Award, their highest national honor for any corporation. We have always placed an emphasis on supporting the communities where we’re located, starting with Cincinnati’s first coordinated community charity in 1915 following devastating floods in the region. 12342005 Tide Loads of Hope The program is launched to help families hit by natural disaster by washing, drying, and folding laundry for them. By 2012, we cleaned more than 34,000 loads of laundry for families affected by disasters, including Hurricane Katrina, the San Diego wildfires, Hurricane Ike and more. In 2017 alone, the Tide Loads of Hope program washes 3,100 loads of laundry. 2004 Children's Safe Drinking Water An employee looks into cleaning water so moms in an African village could do laundry easier. As his team works on a way to reuse the wash water, they leverage P&G laundry technology and soon realize they could get it so clean you could drink it. So instead of laundry, they bring families clean drinking water—a much more important need. 1978 Dawn Wildlife Rescue International Bird Rescue begins testing all major dish soaps for cleaning and discovers that Dawn works the best. It’s the only product strong enough to remove the oil, yet gentle enough to not harm the integrity of the feathers. Since then, P&G has donated over 50,000 bottles and helped more than 75,000 animals. 123Products that broke the moldP&G history is full of never-before-seen innovations that solved problems and inspired the industry to catch up. OUR FUTURE Inventing the Products We Need Partnering with experts & innovators inside and outside our walls, we’re identifying what consumer needs aren’t being met, and developing tech to solve them. Check out what we’re working on now. 2001 The First Razor Designed Specifically for Women For the first time, Gillette asks women about their shaving experience, not just their shaving needs. Venus is developed after recognizing the key differences between men’s and women’s shaving. Using our best blades, Venus incorporates rounded cartridges, anti-bacterial rubber, and in-shower ergonomics and packaging. 1961 Dandruff, Solved Consumers were dissatisfied with existing anti-dandruff shampoos. After 10 years of research, our scientists discovered Pyrithione Zinc, an ingredient that reduces dandruff. We introduce it as Head & Shoulders in 1961 and it quickly becomes one of P&G’s biggest brands. In 1988, we launch is as our first brand in China. 1955 Preventing Tooth Decay Our researchers collaborate with Indiana University to develop the first stable fluoride toothpaste. Crest is introduced and becomes the first toothpaste with fluoride clinically proven to fight cavities and help prevent tooth decay—the second-most prevalent disease at the time. We also start reaching out to dentists, enlisting them to help prevent oral care issues rather than just repairing them—dramatically changing the way people think about taking care of their teeth. In 1960, the American Dental Association recognizes Crest as effective against cavities, catapulting the brands credibility. 12341949 The Soft Toothbrush A California dentist invents Oral-B toothbrushes using soft nylon bristles, out of concern for his patients gums. As a small entrepreneur, he sells them only to his dentist friends who in turn recommend the brand to their patients. Oral-B will grow to become one of the largest global brush brands. 1946 Tide, The Washday Miracle In 1933, Dreft is introduced as the first-ever household synthetic detergent, but research continues to develop a product that can clean consumer’s toughest stains. After almost a decade of failed work, the project is ordered to stop. But for 7 years, the lead researcher secretly works on the product in his spare time. By 1946, he has created a game changing product which is introduced as Tide. Called “The Washday Miracle”, it cleans better than anything on the market. 1879 The Soap That Floats James N. Gamble, son of the founder, recognizes that families must have 2 different bars of soap—one for laundry and one for bathing. He creates an innovative single bar of soap that works for both purposes. Named Ivory Soap, it takes the country by storm as one of the company’s most legendary brands. 123Tech that revolutionized the industryIf there’s one thing we know, it’s that there’s always a smarter, more efficient, simply better way of doing things. This principle has led to P&G products that have changed the way categories think. OUR FUTURE Keeping the Gears Moving We’re constantly working to propel the industry into the future whether it’s with product and packaging innovations, coming up with creative ways to use data, or finding ways to reinvent our business model. 2012 Tide Pods Designed as a detergent + stain remover + brightener in one, Tide Pods breaks through the laundry category. The pods deliver a new formula in a small dose that is HE compatible and twice as compacted as the current 2x Tide Liquid. 1998 Changing the Aircare Category One the biggest unmet consumer needs is finding a way to clean things that can’t go into the washing machine. With that problem in mind Procter & Gamble invents Febreze, a product that doesn’t just cover up bad scent, but actually removes it. 1986 Invention of 2-in-1 Our researchers set out to perfect a formula that cleans, lathers, rinses, and conditions in one convenient step. After more than three years of work, we launch the first “2-in-1” shampoo and conditioner on the market and expand that technology to Head & Shoulders, Pantene, and Vidal Sassoon. 12341965 A New Way to Make Paper Recognizing that people could only buy paper that was either soft or strong, Charmin creates a new way to allow for both in the same tissue, calling it CPF. With this new technology comes the famous ad campaign, “Please don’t squeeze the Charmin”. 1901 Improving the Razor King C. Gillette patents the KC Gillette Razor, an alternative to the straight razor. A breakthrough in the category, its permanent handle and disposable blade provides men with a safe and convenient way to shave. 12Practices that improve people's livesProviding customers with quality products that make every day better has driven our purpose for over 180 years. OUR FUTURE Ingredient Transparency We’re committed to continuing to be transparent about the ingredients we use (and don’t use) so that you can be confident when you add P&G products to your cart. See our fragrance ingredients list here. 2007 P&G in Your Neighborhood Tide Dry Cleaners launches in 2008 and is P&G’s big move into the service industry. It is quickly franchised across the country and in the first two years, serves over 500,000 customers, processes over 3.4 million garments, and creates over 150 jobs. 1941 Talking to Consumers We become one of the first companies to formally respond to consumer correspondence. By 1974, toll-free phone numbers allow consumers to contact us directly. By the 1990s, we incorporate email, and by the 2000s, social media makes connecting with consumers easier than ever. In 2011, we invent a listening solution which lets brands monitor what people are saying about their products in real-time. 1924 Start of Market Research D. Paul "Doc" Smelser, a Ph.D. economist from Johns Hopkins University, joins the team. He collects statistical data breaking out consumers by income and background, making us the first company to conduct deliberate, data-based market research with consumers. This allows us to improve consumer understanding and anticipate their needs to create products that improve everyday life. 12341890 First R&D Lab R&D quickly becomes a critical function at P&G and our first lab is added to the Ivorydale facility. By the 1920s, R&D is an integrated division of our company, employing a staff of several hundred young men and women. The Research Department develops ways to improve products, then passes their findings on to be translated into new manufacturing processes. 1887 Honest Business Ethics P&G products, known for their reputation for quality and being made by a company built on ethics, begin to be recognized through the slogan “Highest Grade, Honest Weight”. A retailer in Chicago, Illinois carries nothing but P&G products due to the demand for trusted products. 1886 An Industrial Masterpiece After a disastrous fire at our first plant, Ivorydale is purposefully built as a modern manufacturing facility. Designed by one of the nation's foremost industrial architects, Solon Beman, the new plant incorporates the latest designs for the safety and comfort of employees. We spend the next 130+ years expanding these manufacturing principles across the globe. 123A company that puts people firstWhat allows us to be one of the largest consumer goods company in the world is filling our buildings with passionate, inspired, motivated people who believe in doing better than good, every day. OUR FUTURE Diversity in Everything We Do We believe in diversity & inclusion. That’s why we support it however we can—from creating flexible work schedules for our employees to building inclusive playgrounds for children with and without disabilities. Learn more about our efforts. 2005 Women in Saudi Arabia We become the first consumer goods company to be granted a license to hire women in Saudi Arabia. Since then, our Saudi team has made significant progress in incorporating the talents and insights of women, while still respecting cultural norms and values. 1992 Women in Senior Positions The percentage of women filling senior management positions increases from 5% in 1992 to 30% in 2011. That same year, over 43% of new management hires from the past 5 years are women. 1992 LGBTQ+ Rights P&G includes sexual orientation in its Equal Employment Opportunity statement. The following year we support the creation of an internal grassroots organization known as GABLE and its efforts for LGBTQ+ inclusion within the company. 12341962 Diversity Programming Two years before the U.S. government mandates it, we initiate a diversity program for all employees—providing training and support to grow leaders regardless of sex, race, or religious orientation. 1905 Education Equality James N. Gamble helps establish what becomes the Bethune-Cookman University. This is just the beginning to the company’s long tradition of supporting historically black colleges and universities. 12Sustainable steps to a brighter futureA snapshot of all our sustainability achievements and efforts. OUR FUTURE Ambition 2030 During Earth Week in 2018, we released new sustainability goals for 2030 with one purpose in mind: to make a positive impact on our environment while creating value for our consumers. Learn more about our plan to address finite resources and growing consumption. 2016 World's 1st Beach Plastic Shampoo Bottle Head & Shoulders produces a bottle made from up to 25% recycled beach plastic—the first major step in establishing a unique supply chain involving thousands of volunteers and hundreds of NGOs. 2013 Making Zero Waste a Reality We announce during Earth Week that 45 P&G sites around the world have achieved zero-manufacturing-waste-to-landfill status, leading us to set bigger goals for 2030. 2005 Coldwater Technology 80-85% of energy used in the laundry process is used to heat water. After researchers discover the environmental impact of that, we design Coldwater Technology to deliver optimal performance at lower temperatures. 12342003 Environmentally-Responsible Flushables We lead the development of guidelines for flushable products published by The Water Environment Research Foundation. 1989 A New Life for Plastics We start using recycled plastic in our packaging, but our use of recycled polypropylene (PP) is limited due to a lack of availability of high-quality material. We need a solution, so one of our scientists invent a sustainable technology that recycles a type of plastic that wasn’t recyclable before—helping us reduce even more waste. 1983 Reducing Packaging & Water Use Triple Concentrate Downy makes its debut as one of P&G’s first products to reduce packaging and water use. Over the years, we improve this responsible tech across other products like Dawn, Fairy, Tide, and Ariel. 1956 Establishing the Importance of Safety The first environmental safety publication at P&G is published, providing research on surfactants (like emulsifiers, detergents, and foaming agents) in rivers. This topic continues to be important to P&G as demonstrated by the biological monitoring program at our paper manufacturing plants in 1969 and the release of our first Annual Global Environmental Report in 1993. 1234Take a look at where we are todaySee our BrandsCommunity impactWho we areBrandsWho we areCommunity impactSustainability

Who we are | P&G principles and valuesWho we are.Making every day more than ordinaryOur brands are trusted in millions of living rooms, kitchens, laundry rooms, and bathrooms—and have been passed down from generation to generation. We are the people behind the brands you trust, and we’re committed to making peoples’ lives better in small but meaningful ways, every day. As P&G grows, we stay grounded in our purpose, values, and principles and a deep-rooted understanding between each other and our company that being our best and doing our best—for the people who buy our products, for one another, and for the world around us—will lead to mutual success. We believe in finding small but meaningful ways to improve lives—now and for generations to come.We make superior quality products See our brandsAnd use every ounce of our power to make a difference See our impactThere is no single equation for success at P&G, because no two P&G people or careers are alike. Just as we strive to deliver a superior consumer experience, we aim to deliver a superior employee value equation as well.

We believe when we support our employees’ wellbeing, they are better able to contribute to the success of the Company and achieve their personal goals.

Citizenship Report 2022 | Procter & Gamble2022 CITIZENSHIP REPORTExplore the reportDELIVERING FOR ALL OUR STAKEHOLDERSJon R. MoellerChairman of the Board, Presidentand Chief Executive OfficerDEAR STAKEHOLDERS,We have been talking about the importance of balance for some time in the context of needing to deliver balanced growth and value creation. While that will always be an imperative, the world needs more from P&G now. It is not just top- and bottom-line growth that must be delivered and balanced. We must also endeavor to deliver against the needs of an increasing number of constituents — consumers, retail customers, employees, society and our shareowners. The needs of each of these constituents must be met. This is especially true of our Citizenship efforts in Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) areas, where expectations among all stakeholders are growing. People increasingly rely on us to deliver superior solutions that are sustainable. Our world requires that we do our part in this regard. This challenge is also an opportunity to extend our margin of superiority, further grow categories, and create more value. We are working across climate, waste, water and nature to improve our own environmental impact, enable consumers to reduce their footprint, and help society solve some of the most pressing global challenges.We are committed to an equal, diverse and inclusive organization and culture; one which brings forth the best ideas and innovations needed to win with consumers and customers and for each other. We do this best when we have a pipeline of outstanding and diverse talent at every level and an environment that supports each of us in being our full and authentic selves. Externally, we support equality and inclusion efforts with our business partners and in our communities because it is not only the right thing to do, but because it also can improve income and wealth equity for more people, creating more purchasing power, which drives market growth. The work we do in communities around the world to support people in difficult times is one of the most tangible ways we have immediate positive impact as a company. By providing clean water and donations of P&G products, time and financial resources to those in need, we help to improve lives. These actions, as well the rest of our Citizenship efforts, are also part of what employees are proud of and value in P&G, helping us attract and retain the best talent. For 185 years, our foundation has been our Purpose, Values and Principles. They set a high standard for each P&G person and require that we hold ourselves and each other accountable for results and, equally important, for how we achieve those results. Last year, we added an ESG factor to our annual incentive compensation program for our senior executives as a demonstration of our commitment to near-term progress toward our long-term ESG goals. You can stay updated on our latest ESG data and reports via our portal at pginvestor.com. In the ever more complex world we live in, it’s not just top- and bottom-line that must be balanced. We must endeavor to balance the needs of consumers, customers, employees, society and shareowners. Serving and balancing these needs will not be easy, but it is necessary — and those that do it best, as I expect we will, should thrive. Jon R. Moeller Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive OfficerREAD MOREINSPIRED, VALUED AND GROWINGOur citizenship efforts reflect the contributions of employees across the Company.

Serendipitous momentsSocial effortsInnovative productsRevolutionary techEveryday practicesPutting people firstSustainable effortsMoments of brillianceSerendipitous strokes of genius and passion-fueled ideas launched iconic brands and defined us as a company. OUR FUTURE Open Call for Ideas Our Connect + Develop program helps us partner with innovators around the world to solve problems for our consumers’ needs. Learn more. 2000 A Food Wrap That Whitens Teeth: Glad Press’n Seal & Crest Whitestrips To combat plastic wrap that loses its grip, P&G develops a technology to create Glad Press’n Seal. At the same time, a young employee working on at-home teeth whitening products connects with his mentor who shares a prototype of the food wrap with him. Sparked by this new idea, they cut the wrap into small strips, and apply it to their teeth. Shortly after, Crest Whitestrips is developed. 1998 One Insight That Led to Easier Cleaning for All: Always & Swiffer Wet Jet A consumer explained to a Products Researcher that while she liked Mr. Clean liquid, it didn’t make the cleaning process any easier. She opened her broom closet—full of mops, brushes, and buckets—and asked him to clean that up. Our researchers combine our capabilities in highly absorbent non-wovens, like the ones used in Always and Pampers, with our cleaner solutions expertise, creating both the Swiffer Wet Jet and the Quick Clean category. 1973 A Softener for the Dryer: Bounce With the addition of dryers in homes, static cling becomes a key issue. P&G finds a new way to deliver fabric softener via a towel. Research quickly led us to an inventor who had already figured it out, and we acquired the technology. Bounce dryer sheets are introduced as a fresh alternative to liquid fabric softeners. 12341961 A Grandfather Inspired by His Grandson: Pampers While watching his first grandchild, a P&G researcher quickly realizes the mess of cloth diapers and the need to carry them until returning home. This leads him and fellow researchers to develop a better & more affordable disposable diaper. Since then, Pampers has continuously advanced—moving from pins to tapes, becoming thinner and more cloth-like, and designed for babies at every stage of development. 1894 A Father's Concern: VapoRub A pharmacist developed several home remedies, such as cough syrups and other liquids that he sold in his local store. One day his infant son became ill. Unsure any of the ingestible products would be effective, he creates an externally-applied salve that releases cough-soothing vapors when heated by the body. His son’s health improves, and generations around the world grow up with VapoRub. 12A corporate force for goodOur employees have been the driving force behind our support for our environment, communities, and people—a practice that has been ingrained in our culture for over a century. OUR FUTURE Building Our Impact Each year, we actively continue to integrate Citizenship into how we do business. The more we do that, the bigger the impact we can make with the people we serve, the communities where we live and work, and the broader world that surrounds us. See what we’re up to now. 2015 Always’ #LikeAGirl The 2015 Super Bowl’s most-liked commercial changes the conversation about girls and sports, taking an unintentionally derogatory phrase and making it one of empowerment, strength, and pride. Millions of girls around the world rally to change #LikeAGirl to mean amazing things. This massive engagement starts to change public perception: while only 19% of girls had a positive association with the phrase “like a girl” before the campaign, 76% agree they no longer view the phrase as an insult after watching the Always #LikeAGirl film. 2012 Summer Olympics Campaign After the success of our 2010 “Proud Sponsor of Moms” campaign, we launch “Thank You, Mom"—a campaign where we support 150 global athletes and their Moms. When asked in what way we can help them most, Moms respond that they'd like to see us support youth sports. For this reason, we commit to raising $25 million globally. 2012 Honored in the Community The United Way—a non-profit organization that fights for health, education, and financial stability—celebrates its 125th Anniversary and awards us with The Spirit of America Award, their highest national honor for any corporation. We have always placed an emphasis on supporting the communities where we’re located, starting with Cincinnati’s first coordinated community charity in 1915 following devastating floods in the region. 12342005 Tide Loads of Hope The program is launched to help families hit by natural disaster by washing, drying, and folding laundry for them. By 2012, we cleaned more than 34,000 loads of laundry for families affected by disasters, including Hurricane Katrina, the San Diego wildfires, Hurricane Ike and more. In 2017 alone, the Tide Loads of Hope program washes 3,100 loads of laundry. 2004 Children's Safe Drinking Water An employee looks into cleaning water so moms in an African village could do laundry easier. As his team works on a way to reuse the wash water, they leverage P&G laundry technology and soon realize they could get it so clean you could drink it. So instead of laundry, they bring families clean drinking water—a much more important need. 1978 Dawn Wildlife Rescue International Bird Rescue begins testing all major dish soaps for cleaning and discovers that Dawn works the best. It’s the only product strong enough to remove the oil, yet gentle enough to not harm the integrity of the feathers. Since then, P&G has donated over 50,000 bottles and helped more than 75,000 animals. 123Products that broke the moldP&G history is full of never-before-seen innovations that solved problems and inspired the industry to catch up. OUR FUTURE Inventing the Products We Need Partnering with experts & innovators inside and outside our walls, we’re identifying what consumer needs aren’t being met, and developing tech to solve them. Check out what we’re working on now. 2001 The First Razor Designed Specifically for Women For the first time, Gillette asks women about their shaving experience, not just their shaving needs. Venus is developed after recognizing the key differences between men’s and women’s shaving. Using our best blades, Venus incorporates rounded cartridges, anti-bacterial rubber, and in-shower ergonomics and packaging. 1961 Dandruff, Solved Consumers were dissatisfied with existing anti-dandruff shampoos. After 10 years of research, our scientists discovered Pyrithione Zinc, an ingredient that reduces dandruff. We introduce it as Head & Shoulders in 1961 and it quickly becomes one of P&G’s biggest brands. In 1988, we launch is as our first brand in China. 1955 Preventing Tooth Decay Our researchers collaborate with Indiana University to develop the first stable fluoride toothpaste. Crest is introduced and becomes the first toothpaste with fluoride clinically proven to fight cavities and help prevent tooth decay—the second-most prevalent disease at the time. We also start reaching out to dentists, enlisting them to help prevent oral care issues rather than just repairing them—dramatically changing the way people think about taking care of their teeth. In 1960, the American Dental Association recognizes Crest as effective against cavities, catapulting the brands credibility. 12341949 The Soft Toothbrush A California dentist invents Oral-B toothbrushes using soft nylon bristles, out of concern for his patients gums. As a small entrepreneur, he sells them only to his dentist friends who in turn recommend the brand to their patients. Oral-B will grow to become one of the largest global brush brands. 1946 Tide, The Washday Miracle In 1933, Dreft is introduced as the first-ever household synthetic detergent, but research continues to develop a product that can clean consumer’s toughest stains. After almost a decade of failed work, the project is ordered to stop. But for 7 years, the lead researcher secretly works on the product in his spare time. By 1946, he has created a game changing product which is introduced as Tide. Called “The Washday Miracle”, it cleans better than anything on the market. 1879 The Soap That Floats James N. Gamble, son of the founder, recognizes that families must have 2 different bars of soap—one for laundry and one for bathing. He creates an innovative single bar of soap that works for both purposes. Named Ivory Soap, it takes the country by storm as one of the company’s most legendary brands. 123Tech that revolutionized the industryIf there’s one thing we know, it’s that there’s always a smarter, more efficient, simply better way of doing things. This principle has led to P&G products that have changed the way categories think. OUR FUTURE Keeping the Gears Moving We’re constantly working to propel the industry into the future whether it’s with product and packaging innovations, coming up with creative ways to use data, or finding ways to reinvent our business model. 2012 Tide Pods Designed as a detergent + stain remover + brightener in one, Tide Pods breaks through the laundry category. The pods deliver a new formula in a small dose that is HE compatible and twice as compacted as the current 2x Tide Liquid. 1998 Changing the Aircare Category One the biggest unmet consumer needs is finding a way to clean things that can’t go into the washing machine. With that problem in mind Procter & Gamble invents Febreze, a product that doesn’t just cover up bad scent, but actually removes it. 1986 Invention of 2-in-1 Our researchers set out to perfect a formula that cleans, lathers, rinses, and conditions in one convenient step. After more than three years of work, we launch the first “2-in-1” shampoo and conditioner on the market and expand that technology to Head & Shoulders, Pantene, and Vidal Sassoon. 12341965 A New Way to Make Paper Recognizing that people could only buy paper that was either soft or strong, Charmin creates a new way to allow for both in the same tissue, calling it CPF. With this new technology comes the famous ad campaign, “Please don’t squeeze the Charmin”. 1901 Improving the Razor King C. Gillette patents the KC Gillette Razor, an alternative to the straight razor. A breakthrough in the category, its permanent handle and disposable blade provides men with a safe and convenient way to shave. 12Practices that improve people's livesProviding customers with quality products that make every day better has driven our purpose for over 180 years. OUR FUTURE Ingredient Transparency We’re committed to continuing to be transparent about the ingredients we use (and don’t use) so that you can be confident when you add P&G products to your cart. See our fragrance ingredients list here. 2007 P&G in Your Neighborhood Tide Dry Cleaners launches in 2008 and is P&G’s big move into the service industry. It is quickly franchised across the country and in the first two years, serves over 500,000 customers, processes over 3.4 million garments, and creates over 150 jobs. 1941 Talking to Consumers We become one of the first companies to formally respond to consumer correspondence. By 1974, toll-free phone numbers allow consumers to contact us directly. By the 1990s, we incorporate email, and by the 2000s, social media makes connecting with consumers easier than ever. In 2011, we invent a listening solution which lets brands monitor what people are saying about their products in real-time. 1924 Start of Market Research D. Paul "Doc" Smelser, a Ph.D. economist from Johns Hopkins University, joins the team. He collects statistical data breaking out consumers by income and background, making us the first company to conduct deliberate, data-based market research with consumers. This allows us to improve consumer understanding and anticipate their needs to create products that improve everyday life. 12341890 First R&D Lab R&D quickly becomes a critical function at P&G and our first lab is added to the Ivorydale facility. By the 1920s, R&D is an integrated division of our company, employing a staff of several hundred young men and women. The Research Department develops ways to improve products, then passes their findings on to be translated into new manufacturing processes. 1887 Honest Business Ethics P&G products, known for their reputation for quality and being made by a company built on ethics, begin to be recognized through the slogan “Highest Grade, Honest Weight”. A retailer in Chicago, Illinois carries nothing but P&G products due to the demand for trusted products. 1886 An Industrial Masterpiece After a disastrous fire at our first plant, Ivorydale is purposefully built as a modern manufacturing facility. Designed by one of the nation's foremost industrial architects, Solon Beman, the new plant incorporates the latest designs for the safety and comfort of employees. We spend the next 130+ years expanding these manufacturing principles across the globe. 123A company that puts people firstWhat allows us to be one of the largest consumer goods company in the world is filling our buildings with passionate, inspired, motivated people who believe in doing better than good, every day. OUR FUTURE Diversity in Everything We Do We believe in diversity & inclusion. That’s why we support it however we can—from creating flexible work schedules for our employees to building inclusive playgrounds for children with and without disabilities. Learn more about our efforts. 2005 Women in Saudi Arabia We become the first consumer goods company to be granted a license to hire women in Saudi Arabia. Since then, our Saudi team has made significant progress in incorporating the talents and insights of women, while still respecting cultural norms and values. 1992 Women in Senior Positions The percentage of women filling senior management positions increases from 5% in 1992 to 30% in 2011. That same year, over 43% of new management hires from the past 5 years are women. 1992 LGBTQ+ Rights P&G includes sexual orientation in its Equal Employment Opportunity statement. The following year we support the creation of an internal grassroots organization known as GABLE and its efforts for LGBTQ+ inclusion within the company. 12341962 Diversity Programming Two years before the U.S. government mandates it, we initiate a diversity program for all employees—providing training and support to grow leaders regardless of sex, race, or religious orientation. 1905 Education Equality James N. Gamble helps establish what becomes the Bethune-Cookman University. This is just the beginning to the company’s long tradition of supporting historically black colleges and universities. 12Sustainable steps to a brighter futureA snapshot of all our sustainability achievements and efforts. OUR FUTURE Ambition 2030 During Earth Week in 2018, we released new sustainability goals for 2030 with one purpose in mind: to make a positive impact on our environment while creating value for our consumers. Learn more about our plan to address finite resources and growing consumption. 2016 World's 1st Beach Plastic Shampoo Bottle Head & Shoulders produces a bottle made from up to 25% recycled beach plastic—the first major step in establishing a unique supply chain involving thousands of volunteers and hundreds of NGOs. 2013 Making Zero Waste a Reality We announce during Earth Week that 45 P&G sites around the world have achieved zero-manufacturing-waste-to-landfill status, leading us to set bigger goals for 2030. 2005 Coldwater Technology 80-85% of energy used in the laundry process is used to heat water. After researchers discover the environmental impact of that, we design Coldwater Technology to deliver optimal performance at lower temperatures. 12342003 Environmentally-Responsible Flushables We lead the development of guidelines for flushable products published by The Water Environment Research Foundation. 1989 A New Life for Plastics We start using recycled plastic in our packaging, but our use of recycled polypropylene (PP) is limited due to a lack of availability of high-quality material. We need a solution, so one of our scientists invent a sustainable technology that recycles a type of plastic that wasn’t recyclable before—helping us reduce even more waste. 1983 Reducing Packaging & Water Use Triple Concentrate Downy makes its debut as one of P&G’s first products to reduce packaging and water use. Over the years, we improve this responsible tech across other products like Dawn, Fairy, Tide, and Ariel. 1956 Establishing the Importance of Safety The first environmental safety publication at P&G is published, providing research on surfactants (like emulsifiers, detergents, and foaming agents) in rivers. This topic continues to be important to P&G as demonstrated by the biological monitoring program at our paper manufacturing plants in 1969 and the release of our first Annual Global Environmental Report in 1993. 1234Take a look at where we are todaySee our BrandsCommunity impactWho we areBrandsWho we areCommunity impactSustainability
