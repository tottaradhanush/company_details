Who we are | P&G principles and valuesWho we are.Making every day more than ordinaryOur brands are trusted in millions of living rooms, kitchens, laundry rooms, and bathrooms—and have been passed down from generation to generation. We are the people behind the brands you trust, and we’re committed to making peoples’ lives better in small but meaningful ways, every day. As P&G grows, we stay grounded in our purpose, values, and principles and a deep-rooted understanding between each other and our company that being our best and doing our best—for the people who buy our products, for one another, and for the world around us—will lead to mutual success. We believe in finding small but meaningful ways to improve lives—now and for generations to come.We make superior quality products See our brandsAnd use every ounce of our power to make a difference See our impactThere is no single equation for success at P&G, because no two P&G people or careers are alike. Just as we strive to deliver a superior consumer experience, we aim to deliver a superior employee value equation as well. We celebrate the uniqueness of each employee’s journey because we know that loyalty and success stem from the times when people feel inspired to make a difference, have equal opportunity and multiple ways to continue growing, feel pride in making an impact and know they’re being valued and rewarded for their contributions to their team’s and our company’s success. We believe when we support our employees’ wellbeing, they are better able to contribute to the success of the Company and achieve their personal goals. That is why P&G’s Total Rewards package is focused on supporting four key wellbeing areas: financial, mental, physical and work-life wellbeing.Hear from a few employees who have shared their story on why they work at P&G.1234567Like what you’re hearing?

Serendipitous momentsSocial effortsInnovative productsRevolutionary techEveryday practicesPutting people firstSustainable effortsMoments of brillianceSerendipitous strokes of genius and passion-fueled ideas launched iconic brands and defined us as a company. OUR FUTURE Open Call for Ideas Our Connect + Develop program helps us partner with innovators around the world to solve problems for our consumers’ needs. Learn more. 2000 A Food Wrap That Whitens Teeth: Glad Press’n Seal & Crest Whitestrips To combat plastic wrap that loses its grip, P&G develops a technology to create Glad Press’n Seal. At the same time, a young employee working on at-home teeth whitening products connects with his mentor who shares a prototype of the food wrap with him. Sparked by this new idea, they cut the wrap into small strips, and apply it to their teeth. Shortly after, Crest Whitestrips is developed. 1998 One Insight That Led to Easier Cleaning for All: Always & Swiffer Wet Jet A consumer explained to a Products Researcher that while she liked Mr. Clean liquid, it didn’t make the cleaning process any easier. She opened her broom closet—full of mops, brushes, and buckets—and asked him to clean that up. Our researchers combine our capabilities in highly absorbent non-wovens, like the ones used in Always and Pampers, with our cleaner solutions expertise, creating both the Swiffer Wet Jet and the Quick Clean category. 1973 A Softener for the Dryer: Bounce With the addition of dryers in homes, static cling becomes a key issue. P&G finds a new way to deliver fabric softener via a towel. Research quickly led us to an inventor who had already figured it out, and we acquired the technology. Bounce dryer sheets are introduced as a fresh alternative to liquid fabric softeners. 12341961 A Grandfather Inspired by His Grandson: Pampers While watching his first grandchild, a P&G researcher quickly realizes the mess of cloth diapers and the need to carry them until returning home. This leads him and fellow researchers to develop a better & more affordable disposable diaper. Since then, Pampers has continuously advanced—moving from pins to tapes, becoming thinner and more cloth-like, and designed for babies at every stage of development. 1894 A Father's Concern: VapoRub A pharmacist developed several home remedies, such as cough syrups and other liquids that he sold in his local store. One day his infant son became ill. Unsure any of the ingestible products would be effective, he creates an externally-applied salve that releases cough-soothing vapors when heated by the body. His son’s health improves, and generations around the world grow up with VapoRub. 12A corporate force for goodOur employees have been the driving force behind our support for our environment, communities, and people—a practice that has been ingrained in our culture for over a century. OUR FUTURE Building Our Impact Each year, we actively continue to integrate Citizenship into how we do business. The more we do that, the bigger the impact we can make with the people we serve, the communities where we live and work, and the broader world that surrounds us. See what we’re up to now. 2015 Always’ #LikeAGirl The 2015 Super Bowl’s most-liked commercial changes the conversation about girls and sports, taking an unintentionally derogatory phrase and making it one of empowerment, strength, and pride. Millions of girls around the world rally to change #LikeAGirl to mean amazing things. This massive engagement starts to change public perception: while only 19% of girls had a positive association with the phrase “like a girl” before the campaign, 76% agree they no longer view the phrase as an insult after watching the Always #LikeAGirl film. 2012 Summer Olympics Campaign After the success of our 2010 “Proud Sponsor of Moms” campaign, we launch “Thank You, Mom"—a campaign where we support 150 global athletes and their Moms. When asked in what way we can help them most, Moms respond that they'd like to see us support youth sports. For this reason, we commit to raising $25 million globally. 2012 Honored in the Community The United Way—a non-profit organization that fights for health, education, and financial stability—celebrates its 125th Anniversary and awards us with The Spirit of America Award, their highest national honor for any corporation. We have always placed an emphasis on supporting the communities where we’re located, starting with Cincinnati’s first coordinated community charity in 1915 following devastating floods in the region. 12342005 Tide Loads of Hope The program is launched to help families hit by natural disaster by washing, drying, and folding laundry for them. By 2012, we cleaned more than 34,000 loads of laundry for families affected by disasters, including Hurricane Katrina, the San Diego wildfires, Hurricane Ike and more. In 2017 alone, the Tide Loads of Hope program washes 3,100 loads of laundry. 2004 Children's Safe Drinking Water An employee looks into cleaning water so moms in an African village could do laundry easier. As his team works on a way to reuse the wash water, they leverage P&G laundry technology and soon realize they could get it so clean you could drink it. So instead of laundry, they bring families clean drinking water—a much more important need. 1978 Dawn Wildlife Rescue International Bird Rescue begins testing all major dish soaps for cleaning and discovers that Dawn works the best. It’s the only product strong enough to remove the oil, yet gentle enough to not harm the integrity of the feathers. Since then, P&G has donated over 50,000 bottles and helped more than 75,000 animals. 123Products that broke the moldP&G history is full of never-before-seen innovations that solved problems and inspired the industry to catch up. OUR FUTURE Inventing the Products We Need Partnering with experts & innovators inside and outside our walls, we’re identifying what consumer needs aren’t being met, and developing tech to solve them. Check out what we’re working on now. 2001 The First Razor Designed Specifically for Women For the first time, Gillette asks women about their shaving experience, not just their shaving needs. Venus is developed after recognizing the key differences between men’s and women’s shaving. Using our best blades, Venus incorporates rounded cartridges, anti-bacterial rubber, and in-shower ergonomics and packaging. 1961 Dandruff, Solved Consumers were dissatisfied with existing anti-dandruff shampoos. After 10 years of research, our scientists discovered Pyrithione Zinc, an ingredient that reduces dandruff. We introduce it as Head & Shoulders in 1961 and it quickly becomes one of P&G’s biggest brands. In 1988, we launch is as our first brand in China. 1955 Preventing Tooth Decay Our researchers collaborate with Indiana University to develop the first stable fluoride toothpaste. Crest is introduced and becomes the first toothpaste with fluoride clinically proven to fight cavities and help prevent tooth decay—the second-most prevalent disease at the time. We also start reaching out to dentists, enlisting them to help prevent oral care issues rather than just repairing them—dramatically changing the way people think about taking care of their teeth. In 1960, the American Dental Association recognizes Crest as effective against cavities, catapulting the brands credibility. 12341949 The Soft Toothbrush A California dentist invents Oral-B toothbrushes using soft nylon bristles, out of concern for his patients gums. As a small entrepreneur, he sells them only to his dentist friends who in turn recommend the brand to their patients. Oral-B will grow to become one of the largest global brush brands. 1946 Tide, The Washday Miracle In 1933, Dreft is introduced as the first-ever household synthetic detergent, but research continues to develop a product that can clean consumer’s toughest stains. After almost a decade of failed work, the project is ordered to stop. But for 7 years, the lead researcher secretly works on the product in his spare time. By 1946, he has created a game changing product which is introduced as Tide. Called “The Washday Miracle”, it cleans better than anything on the market. 1879 The Soap That Floats James N. Gamble, son of the founder, recognizes that families must have 2 different bars of soap—one for laundry and one for bathing. He creates an innovative single bar of soap that works for both purposes. Named Ivory Soap, it takes the country by storm as one of the company’s most legendary brands. 123Tech that revolutionized the industryIf there’s one thing we know, it’s that there’s always a smarter, more efficient, simply better way of doing things. This principle has led to P&G products that have changed the way categories think. OUR FUTURE Keeping the Gears Moving We’re constantly working to propel the industry into the future whether it’s with product and packaging innovations, coming up with creative ways to use data, or finding ways to reinvent our business model. 2012 Tide Pods Designed as a detergent + stain remover + brightener in one, Tide Pods breaks through the laundry category. The pods deliver a new formula in a small dose that is HE compatible and twice as compacted as the current 2x Tide Liquid. 1998 Changing the Aircare Category One the biggest unmet consumer needs is finding a way to clean things that can’t go into the washing machine. With that problem in mind Procter & Gamble invents Febreze, a product that doesn’t just cover up bad scent, but actually removes it. 1986 Invention of 2-in-1 Our researchers set out to perfect a formula that cleans, lathers, rinses, and conditions in one convenient step. After more than three years of work, we launch the first “2-in-1” shampoo and conditioner on the market and expand that technology to Head & Shoulders, Pantene, and Vidal Sassoon. 12341965 A New Way to Make Paper Recognizing that people could only buy paper that was either soft or strong, Charmin creates a new way to allow for both in the same tissue, calling it CPF. With this new technology comes the famous ad campaign, “Please don’t squeeze the Charmin”. 1901 Improving the Razor King C. Gillette patents the KC Gillette Razor, an alternative to the straight razor. A breakthrough in the category, its permanent handle and disposable blade provides men with a safe and convenient way to shave. 12Practices that improve people's livesProviding customers with quality products that make every day better has driven our purpose for over 180 years. OUR FUTURE Ingredient Transparency We’re committed to continuing to be transparent about the ingredients we use (and don’t use) so that you can be confident when you add P&G products to your cart. See our fragrance ingredients list here. 2007 P&G in Your Neighborhood Tide Dry Cleaners launches in 2008 and is P&G’s big move into the service industry. It is quickly franchised across the country and in the first two years, serves over 500,000 customers, processes over 3.4 million garments, and creates over 150 jobs. 1941 Talking to Consumers We become one of the first companies to formally respond to consumer correspondence. By 1974, toll-free phone numbers allow consumers to contact us directly. By the 1990s, we incorporate email, and by the 2000s, social media makes connecting with consumers easier than ever. In 2011, we invent a listening solution which lets brands monitor what people are saying about their products in real-time. 1924 Start of Market Research D. Paul "Doc" Smelser, a Ph.D. economist from Johns Hopkins University, joins the team. He collects statistical data breaking out consumers by income and background, making us the first company to conduct deliberate, data-based market research with consumers. This allows us to improve consumer understanding and anticipate their needs to create products that improve everyday life. 12341890 First R&D Lab R&D quickly becomes a critical function at P&G and our first lab is added to the Ivorydale facility. By the 1920s, R&D is an integrated division of our company, employing a staff of several hundred young men and women. The Research Department develops ways to improve products, then passes their findings on to be translated into new manufacturing processes. 1887 Honest Business Ethics P&G products, known for their reputation for quality and being made by a company built on ethics, begin to be recognized through the slogan “Highest Grade, Honest Weight”. A retailer in Chicago, Illinois carries nothing but P&G products due to the demand for trusted products. 1886 An Industrial Masterpiece After a disastrous fire at our first plant, Ivorydale is purposefully built as a modern manufacturing facility. Designed by one of the nation's foremost industrial architects, Solon Beman, the new plant incorporates the latest designs for the safety and comfort of employees. We spend the next 130+ years expanding these manufacturing principles across the globe. 123A company that puts people firstWhat allows us to be one of the largest consumer goods company in the world is filling our buildings with passionate, inspired, motivated people who believe in doing better than good, every day. OUR FUTURE Diversity in Everything We Do We believe in diversity & inclusion. That’s why we support it however we can—from creating flexible work schedules for our employees to building inclusive playgrounds for children with and without disabilities. Learn more about our efforts. 2005 Women in Saudi Arabia We become the first consumer goods company to be granted a license to hire women in Saudi Arabia. Since then, our Saudi team has made significant progress in incorporating the talents and insights of women, while still respecting cultural norms and values. 1992 Women in Senior Positions The percentage of women filling senior management positions increases from 5% in 1992 to 30% in 2011. That same year, over 43% of new management hires from the past 5 years are women. 1992 LGBTQ+ Rights P&G includes sexual orientation in its Equal Employment Opportunity statement. The following year we support the creation of an internal grassroots organization known as GABLE and its efforts for LGBTQ+ inclusion within the company. 12341962 Diversity Programming Two years before the U.S. government mandates it, we initiate a diversity program for all employees—providing training and support to grow leaders regardless of sex, race, or religious orientation. 1905 Education Equality James N. Gamble helps establish what becomes the Bethune-Cookman University. This is just the beginning to the company’s long tradition of supporting historically black colleges and universities. 12Sustainable steps to a brighter futureA snapshot of all our sustainability achievements and efforts. OUR FUTURE Ambition 2030 During Earth Week in 2018, we released new sustainability goals for 2030 with one purpose in mind: to make a positive impact on our environment while creating value for our consumers. Learn more about our plan to address finite resources and growing consumption. 2016 World's 1st Beach Plastic Shampoo Bottle Head & Shoulders produces a bottle made from up to 25% recycled beach plastic—the first major step in establishing a unique supply chain involving thousands of volunteers and hundreds of NGOs. 2013 Making Zero Waste a Reality We announce during Earth Week that 45 P&G sites around the world have achieved zero-manufacturing-waste-to-landfill status, leading us to set bigger goals for 2030. 2005 Coldwater Technology 80-85% of energy used in the laundry process is used to heat water. After researchers discover the environmental impact of that, we design Coldwater Technology to deliver optimal performance at lower temperatures. 12342003 Environmentally-Responsible Flushables We lead the development of guidelines for flushable products published by The Water Environment Research Foundation. 1989 A New Life for Plastics We start using recycled plastic in our packaging, but our use of recycled polypropylene (PP) is limited due to a lack of availability of high-quality material. We need a solution, so one of our scientists invent a sustainable technology that recycles a type of plastic that wasn’t recyclable before—helping us reduce even more waste. 1983 Reducing Packaging & Water Use Triple Concentrate Downy makes its debut as one of P&G’s first products to reduce packaging and water use. Over the years, we improve this responsible tech across other products like Dawn, Fairy, Tide, and Ariel. 1956 Establishing the Importance of Safety The first environmental safety publication at P&G is published, providing research on surfactants (like emulsifiers, detergents, and foaming agents) in rivers. This topic continues to be important to P&G as demonstrated by the biological monitoring program at our paper manufacturing plants in 1969 and the release of our first Annual Global Environmental Report in 1993. 1234Take a look at where we are todaySee our BrandsCommunity impactWho we areBrandsWho we areCommunity impactSustainability

Serendipitous momentsSocial effortsInnovative productsRevolutionary techEveryday practicesPutting people firstSustainable effortsMoments of brillianceSerendipitous strokes of genius and passion-fueled ideas launched iconic brands and defined us as a company. OUR FUTURE Open Call for Ideas Our Connect + Develop program helps us partner with innovators around the world to solve problems for our consumers’ needs. Learn more. 2000 A Food Wrap That Whitens Teeth: Glad Press’n Seal & Crest Whitestrips To combat plastic wrap that loses its grip, P&G develops a technology to create Glad Press’n Seal. At the same time, a young employee working on at-home teeth whitening products connects with his mentor who shares a prototype of the food wrap with him. Sparked by this new idea, they cut the wrap into small strips, and apply it to their teeth. Shortly after, Crest Whitestrips is developed. 1998 One Insight That Led to Easier Cleaning for All: Always & Swiffer Wet Jet A consumer explained to a Products Researcher that while she liked Mr. Clean liquid, it didn’t make the cleaning process any easier. She opened her broom closet—full of mops, brushes, and buckets—and asked him to clean that up. Our researchers combine our capabilities in highly absorbent non-wovens, like the ones used in Always and Pampers, with our cleaner solutions expertise, creating both the Swiffer Wet Jet and the Quick Clean category. 1973 A Softener for the Dryer: Bounce With the addition of dryers in homes, static cling becomes a key issue. P&G finds a new way to deliver fabric softener via a towel. Research quickly led us to an inventor who had already figured it out, and we acquired the technology. Bounce dryer sheets are introduced as a fresh alternative to liquid fabric softeners. 12341961 A Grandfather Inspired by His Grandson: Pampers While watching his first grandchild, a P&G researcher quickly realizes the mess of cloth diapers and the need to carry them until returning home. This leads him and fellow researchers to develop a better & more affordable disposable diaper. Since then, Pampers has continuously advanced—moving from pins to tapes, becoming thinner and more cloth-like, and designed for babies at every stage of development. 1894 A Father's Concern: VapoRub A pharmacist developed several home remedies, such as cough syrups and other liquids that he sold in his local store. One day his infant son became ill. Unsure any of the ingestible products would be effective, he creates an externally-applied salve that releases cough-soothing vapors when heated by the body. His son’s health improves, and generations around the world grow up with VapoRub. 12A corporate force for goodOur employees have been the driving force behind our support for our environment, communities, and people—a practice that has been ingrained in our culture for over a century. OUR FUTURE Building Our Impact Each year, we actively continue to integrate Citizenship into how we do business. The more we do that, the bigger the impact we can make with the people we serve, the communities where we live and work, and the broader world that surrounds us. See what we’re up to now. 2015 Always’ #LikeAGirl The 2015 Super Bowl’s most-liked commercial changes the conversation about girls and sports, taking an unintentionally derogatory phrase and making it one of empowerment, strength, and pride. Millions of girls around the world rally to change #LikeAGirl to mean amazing things. This massive engagement starts to change public perception: while only 19% of girls had a positive association with the phrase “like a girl” before the campaign, 76% agree they no longer view the phrase as an insult after watching the Always #LikeAGirl film. 2012 Summer Olympics Campaign After the success of our 2010 “Proud Sponsor of Moms” campaign, we launch “Thank You, Mom"—a campaign where we support 150 global athletes and their Moms. When asked in what way we can help them most, Moms respond that they'd like to see us support youth sports. For this reason, we commit to raising $25 million globally. 2012 Honored in the Community The United Way—a non-profit organization that fights for health, education, and financial stability—celebrates its 125th Anniversary and awards us with The Spirit of America Award, their highest national honor for any corporation. We have always placed an emphasis on supporting the communities where we’re located, starting with Cincinnati’s first coordinated community charity in 1915 following devastating floods in the region. 12342005 Tide Loads of Hope The program is launched to help families hit by natural disaster by washing, drying, and folding laundry for them. By 2012, we cleaned more than 34,000 loads of laundry for families affected by disasters, including Hurricane Katrina, the San Diego wildfires, Hurricane Ike and more. In 2017 alone, the Tide Loads of Hope program washes 3,100 loads of laundry. 2004 Children's Safe Drinking Water An employee looks into cleaning water so moms in an African village could do laundry easier. As his team works on a way to reuse the wash water, they leverage P&G laundry technology and soon realize they could get it so clean you could drink it. So instead of laundry, they bring families clean drinking water—a much more important need. 1978 Dawn Wildlife Rescue International Bird Rescue begins testing all major dish soaps for cleaning and discovers that Dawn works the best. It’s the only product strong enough to remove the oil, yet gentle enough to not harm the integrity of the feathers. Since then, P&G has donated over 50,000 bottles and helped more than 75,000 animals. 123Products that broke the moldP&G history is full of never-before-seen innovations that solved problems and inspired the industry to catch up. OUR FUTURE Inventing the Products We Need Partnering with experts & innovators inside and outside our walls, we’re identifying what consumer needs aren’t being met, and developing tech to solve them. Check out what we’re working on now. 2001 The First Razor Designed Specifically for Women For the first time, Gillette asks women about their shaving experience, not just their shaving needs. Venus is developed after recognizing the key differences between men’s and women’s shaving. Using our best blades, Venus incorporates rounded cartridges, anti-bacterial rubber, and in-shower ergonomics and packaging. 1961 Dandruff, Solved Consumers were dissatisfied with existing anti-dandruff shampoos. After 10 years of research, our scientists discovered Pyrithione Zinc, an ingredient that reduces dandruff. We introduce it as Head & Shoulders in 1961 and it quickly becomes one of P&G’s biggest brands. In 1988, we launch is as our first brand in China. 1955 Preventing Tooth Decay Our researchers collaborate with Indiana University to develop the first stable fluoride toothpaste. Crest is introduced and becomes the first toothpaste with fluoride clinically proven to fight cavities and help prevent tooth decay—the second-most prevalent disease at the time. We also start reaching out to dentists, enlisting them to help prevent oral care issues rather than just repairing them—dramatically changing the way people think about taking care of their teeth. In 1960, the American Dental Association recognizes Crest as effective against cavities, catapulting the brands credibility. 12341949 The Soft Toothbrush A California dentist invents Oral-B toothbrushes using soft nylon bristles, out of concern for his patients gums. As a small entrepreneur, he sells them only to his dentist friends who in turn recommend the brand to their patients. Oral-B will grow to become one of the largest global brush brands. 1946 Tide, The Washday Miracle In 1933, Dreft is introduced as the first-ever household synthetic detergent, but research continues to develop a product that can clean consumer’s toughest stains. After almost a decade of failed work, the project is ordered to stop. But for 7 years, the lead researcher secretly works on the product in his spare time. By 1946, he has created a game changing product which is introduced as Tide. Called “The Washday Miracle”, it cleans better than anything on the market. 1879 The Soap That Floats James N. Gamble, son of the founder, recognizes that families must have 2 different bars of soap—one for laundry and one for bathing. He creates an innovative single bar of soap that works for both purposes. Named Ivory Soap, it takes the country by storm as one of the company’s most legendary brands. 123Tech that revolutionized the industryIf there’s one thing we know, it’s that there’s always a smarter, more efficient, simply better way of doing things. This principle has led to P&G products that have changed the way categories think. OUR FUTURE Keeping the Gears Moving We’re constantly working to propel the industry into the future whether it’s with product and packaging innovations, coming up with creative ways to use data, or finding ways to reinvent our business model. 2012 Tide Pods Designed as a detergent + stain remover + brightener in one, Tide Pods breaks through the laundry category. The pods deliver a new formula in a small dose that is HE compatible and twice as compacted as the current 2x Tide Liquid. 1998 Changing the Aircare Category One the biggest unmet consumer needs is finding a way to clean things that can’t go into the washing machine. With that problem in mind Procter & Gamble invents Febreze, a product that doesn’t just cover up bad scent, but actually removes it. 1986 Invention of 2-in-1 Our researchers set out to perfect a formula that cleans, lathers, rinses, and conditions in one convenient step. After more than three years of work, we launch the first “2-in-1” shampoo and conditioner on the market and expand that technology to Head & Shoulders, Pantene, and Vidal Sassoon. 12341965 A New Way to Make Paper Recognizing that people could only buy paper that was either soft or strong, Charmin creates a new way to allow for both in the same tissue, calling it CPF. With this new technology comes the famous ad campaign, “Please don’t squeeze the Charmin”. 1901 Improving the Razor King C. Gillette patents the KC Gillette Razor, an alternative to the straight razor. A breakthrough in the category, its permanent handle and disposable blade provides men with a safe and convenient way to shave. 12Practices that improve people's livesProviding customers with quality products that make every day better has driven our purpose for over 180 years. OUR FUTURE Ingredient Transparency We’re committed to continuing to be transparent about the ingredients we use (and don’t use) so that you can be confident when you add P&G products to your cart. See our fragrance ingredients list here. 2007 P&G in Your Neighborhood Tide Dry Cleaners launches in 2008 and is P&G’s big move into the service industry. It is quickly franchised across the country and in the first two years, serves over 500,000 customers, processes over 3.4 million garments, and creates over 150 jobs. 1941 Talking to Consumers We become one of the first companies to formally respond to consumer correspondence. By 1974, toll-free phone numbers allow consumers to contact us directly. By the 1990s, we incorporate email, and by the 2000s, social media makes connecting with consumers easier than ever. In 2011, we invent a listening solution which lets brands monitor what people are saying about their products in real-time. 1924 Start of Market Research D. Paul "Doc" Smelser, a Ph.D. economist from Johns Hopkins University, joins the team. He collects statistical data breaking out consumers by income and background, making us the first company to conduct deliberate, data-based market research with consumers. This allows us to improve consumer understanding and anticipate their needs to create products that improve everyday life. 12341890 First R&D Lab R&D quickly becomes a critical function at P&G and our first lab is added to the Ivorydale facility. By the 1920s, R&D is an integrated division of our company, employing a staff of several hundred young men and women. The Research Department develops ways to improve products, then passes their findings on to be translated into new manufacturing processes. 1887 Honest Business Ethics P&G products, known for their reputation for quality and being made by a company built on ethics, begin to be recognized through the slogan “Highest Grade, Honest Weight”. A retailer in Chicago, Illinois carries nothing but P&G products due to the demand for trusted products. 1886 An Industrial Masterpiece After a disastrous fire at our first plant, Ivorydale is purposefully built as a modern manufacturing facility. Designed by one of the nation's foremost industrial architects, Solon Beman, the new plant incorporates the latest designs for the safety and comfort of employees. We spend the next 130+ years expanding these manufacturing principles across the globe. 123A company that puts people firstWhat allows us to be one of the largest consumer goods company in the world is filling our buildings with passionate, inspired, motivated people who believe in doing better than good, every day. OUR FUTURE Diversity in Everything We Do We believe in diversity & inclusion. That’s why we support it however we can—from creating flexible work schedules for our employees to building inclusive playgrounds for children with and without disabilities. Learn more about our efforts. 2005 Women in Saudi Arabia We become the first consumer goods company to be granted a license to hire women in Saudi Arabia. Since then, our Saudi team has made significant progress in incorporating the talents and insights of women, while still respecting cultural norms and values. 1992 Women in Senior Positions The percentage of women filling senior management positions increases from 5% in 1992 to 30% in 2011. That same year, over 43% of new management hires from the past 5 years are women. 1992 LGBTQ+ Rights P&G includes sexual orientation in its Equal Employment Opportunity statement. The following year we support the creation of an internal grassroots organization known as GABLE and its efforts for LGBTQ+ inclusion within the company. 12341962 Diversity Programming Two years before the U.S. government mandates it, we initiate a diversity program for all employees—providing training and support to grow leaders regardless of sex, race, or religious orientation. 1905 Education Equality James N. Gamble helps establish what becomes the Bethune-Cookman University. This is just the beginning to the company’s long tradition of supporting historically black colleges and universities. 12Sustainable steps to a brighter futureA snapshot of all our sustainability achievements and efforts. OUR FUTURE Ambition 2030 During Earth Week in 2018, we released new sustainability goals for 2030 with one purpose in mind: to make a positive impact on our environment while creating value for our consumers. Learn more about our plan to address finite resources and growing consumption. 2016 World's 1st Beach Plastic Shampoo Bottle Head & Shoulders produces a bottle made from up to 25% recycled beach plastic—the first major step in establishing a unique supply chain involving thousands of volunteers and hundreds of NGOs. 2013 Making Zero Waste a Reality We announce during Earth Week that 45 P&G sites around the world have achieved zero-manufacturing-waste-to-landfill status, leading us to set bigger goals for 2030. 2005 Coldwater Technology 80-85% of energy used in the laundry process is used to heat water. After researchers discover the environmental impact of that, we design Coldwater Technology to deliver optimal performance at lower temperatures. 12342003 Environmentally-Responsible Flushables We lead the development of guidelines for flushable products published by The Water Environment Research Foundation. 1989 A New Life for Plastics We start using recycled plastic in our packaging, but our use of recycled polypropylene (PP) is limited due to a lack of availability of high-quality material. We need a solution, so one of our scientists invent a sustainable technology that recycles a type of plastic that wasn’t recyclable before—helping us reduce even more waste. 1983 Reducing Packaging & Water Use Triple Concentrate Downy makes its debut as one of P&G’s first products to reduce packaging and water use. Over the years, we improve this responsible tech across other products like Dawn, Fairy, Tide, and Ariel. 1956 Establishing the Importance of Safety The first environmental safety publication at P&G is published, providing research on surfactants (like emulsifiers, detergents, and foaming agents) in rivers. This topic continues to be important to P&G as demonstrated by the biological monitoring program at our paper manufacturing plants in 1969 and the release of our first Annual Global Environmental Report in 1993. 1234Take a look at where we are todaySee our BrandsCommunity impactWho we areBrandsWho we areCommunity impactSustainability

P&G corporate governanceStructure & Governance×Corporate Governance Overview At P&G, our Purpose, Values and Principles (PVPs) are the foundation of everything we do – this includes Corporate Governance. Corporate Governance is how the management, shareholders and Board of Directors ensure all investors—both shareholders and creditors—are protected against managers acting solely in their best interest. Our governance consists of laws, policies, procedures and practices that protect the well-being of P&G. The policies, procedures and practices in this section demonstrate how seriously we take corporate governance. Our management acts as long-term investors because they, like most P&G employees at all levels, are in fact long-term investors. Employees are long-term investors In 1887, before P&G was even a publicly traded company, William Cooper Procter introduced a profit-sharing program for employees. At the time, he said, “We should let the employees share in the firm’s earnings. That will give them an incentive to increase earnings.” He revised that program in 1903 to have the profit sharing be awarded in the form of actual P&G stock. He reasoned that as employees became stockholders, their economic interests and those of the Company would be bound more closely together. That program still exists today, with a large part of each U.S. employee’s retirement consisting of P&G stock. Additionally, virtually all employees own P&G stock or stock rights via various investment programs. Because of this, employees’ economic interests are aligned with the Company. Our Executive Share Ownership Program requires senior executives to own shares of company stock and/or restricted stock units valued at eight times base salary for the CEO, and five times base salary for the other senior executives. Non-employee directors must own company stock and/or restricted stock units worth six times their annual cash retainer. These compensation programs help to ensure the alignment of the interests of our senior executives and directors with shareholders. A foundation of integrity P&G has a strong history of operating with integrity throughout the company—at all levels, in all countries, both internally and externally. Our actions and the actions of all our employees are governed by our Purpose, Values and Principles. The basis for every decision we make at P&G can be found in our Purpose, Values and Principles—our PVPs. The clarity and constancy of the Company’s PVPs is the one factor above all others that has driven the Company’s growth over generations. Our commitment to operate responsibly is reflected in the steps we have in place to ensure rigorous financial discipline and Corporate Governance. We have an active, capable and diligent Board of Directors that meets the required standards of independence, with members who understand their role in providing strong Corporate Governance. Our Audit Committee is composed exclusively of independent directors with significant financial knowledge and experience. The Audit Committee also meets regularly in private session with the Company’s independent auditors, Deloitte & Touche LLP. We maintain a strong internal control environment. Our rigorous business process controls include written policies and procedures, segregation of duties and the careful selection and development of employees. The system is designed to provide reasonable assurance that transactions are executed as authorized and appropriately recorded, that assets are safeguarded and that accounting records are sufficiently reliable to permit the preparation of financial statements conforming in all material respects with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. We monitor these internal controls through an ongoing program of audit self-assessment and internal and external audits. We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed is recorded, processed, summarized and reported in a timely and accurate manner. Our Disclosure Committee is comprised of senior-level executives responsible for evaluating disclosure implications of significant business activities and events. We execute financial stewardship by maintaining specific programs and activities to ensure that employees understand their fiduciary responsibilities to shareholders. This ongoing effort encompasses financial discipline in strategic and daily business decisions and brings particular focus to maintaining accurate financial reporting and effective controls. In addition, our Global Leadership Council is actively involved in rigorous oversight of the business. We reinforce key employee responsibilities through the Company’s Worldwide Business Conduct, which details management’s and the Board of Directors’ commitment to conduct the Company’s business affairs with high ethical standards. Every employee is required to be trained on the Company’s Worldwide Business Conduct Manual, and every employee is held personally accountable for compliance. Portions of the Worldwide Business Conduct Manual comprise P&G’s Code of Ethics for SEC and New York Stock Exchange Regulatory Purposes, as further described in the Manual. Doing what's right Our reputation is earned by our conduct. What we say, what we do, the products we make, the services we provide and the way we act define us as a company. As conscientious citizens and employees, we only want to do what’s right. As a global leader, this is the only way to do business. BrandsWho we areCommunity impactSustainability

In 1960, the American Dental Association recognizes Crest as effective against cavities, catapulting the brands credibility. 12341949 The Soft Toothbrush A California dentist invents Oral-B toothbrushes using soft nylon bristles, out of concern for his patients gums. As a small entrepreneur, he sells them only to his dentist friends who in turn recommend the brand to their patients. Oral-B will grow to become one of the largest global brush brands. 1946 Tide, The Washday Miracle In 1933, Dreft is introduced as the first-ever household synthetic detergent, but research continues to develop a product that can clean consumer’s toughest stains. After almost a decade of failed work, the project is ordered to stop. But for 7 years, the lead researcher secretly works on the product in his spare time. By 1946, he has created a game changing product which is introduced as Tide. Called “The Washday Miracle”, it cleans better than anything on the market. 1879 The Soap That Floats James N. Gamble, son of the founder, recognizes that families must have 2 different bars of soap—one for laundry and one for bathing. He creates an innovative single bar of soap that works for both purposes. Named Ivory Soap, it takes the country by storm as one of the company’s most legendary brands. 123Tech that revolutionized the industryIf there’s one thing we know, it’s that there’s always a smarter, more efficient, simply better way of doing things. This principle has led to P&G products that have changed the way categories think. OUR FUTURE Keeping the Gears Moving We’re constantly working to propel the industry into the future whether it’s with product and packaging innovations, coming up with creative ways to use data, or finding ways to reinvent our business model. 2012 Tide Pods Designed as a detergent + stain remover + brightener in one, Tide Pods breaks through the laundry category. The pods deliver a new formula in a small dose that is HE compatible and twice as compacted as the current 2x Tide Liquid. 1998 Changing the Aircare Category One the biggest unmet consumer needs is finding a way to clean things that can’t go into the washing machine. With that problem in mind Procter & Gamble invents Febreze, a product that doesn’t just cover up bad scent, but actually removes it. 1986 Invention of 2-in-1 Our researchers set out to perfect a formula that cleans, lathers, rinses, and conditions in one convenient step. After more than three years of work, we launch the first “2-in-1” shampoo and conditioner on the market and expand that technology to Head & Shoulders, Pantene, and Vidal Sassoon. 12341965 A New Way to Make Paper Recognizing that people could only buy paper that was either soft or strong, Charmin creates a new way to allow for both in the same tissue, calling it CPF. With this new technology comes the famous ad campaign, “Please don’t squeeze the Charmin”. 1901 Improving the Razor King C. Gillette patents the KC Gillette Razor, an alternative to the straight razor. A breakthrough in the category, its permanent handle and disposable blade provides men with a safe and convenient way to shave. 12Practices that improve people's livesProviding customers with quality products that make every day better has driven our purpose for over 180 years. OUR FUTURE Ingredient Transparency We’re committed to continuing to be transparent about the ingredients we use (and don’t use) so that you can be confident when you add P&G products to your cart. See our fragrance ingredients list here. 2007 P&G in Your Neighborhood Tide Dry Cleaners launches in 2008 and is P&G’s big move into the service industry. It is quickly franchised across the country and in the first two years, serves over 500,000 customers, processes over 3.4 million garments, and creates over 150 jobs. 1941 Talking to Consumers We become one of the first companies to formally respond to consumer correspondence. By 1974, toll-free phone numbers allow consumers to contact us directly. By the 1990s, we incorporate email, and by the 2000s, social media makes connecting with consumers easier than ever. In 2011, we invent a listening solution which lets brands monitor what people are saying about their products in real-time. 1924 Start of Market Research D. Paul "Doc" Smelser, a Ph.D. economist from Johns Hopkins University, joins the team. He collects statistical data breaking out consumers by income and background, making us the first company to conduct deliberate, data-based market research with consumers. This allows us to improve consumer understanding and anticipate their needs to create products that improve everyday life. 12341890 First R&D Lab R&D quickly becomes a critical function at P&G and our first lab is added to the Ivorydale facility. By the 1920s, R&D is an integrated division of our company, employing a staff of several hundred young men and women. The Research Department develops ways to improve products, then passes their findings on to be translated into new manufacturing processes. 1887 Honest Business Ethics P&G products, known for their reputation for quality and being made by a company built on ethics, begin to be recognized through the slogan “Highest Grade, Honest Weight”. A retailer in Chicago, Illinois carries nothing but P&G products due to the demand for trusted products. 1886 An Industrial Masterpiece After a disastrous fire at our first plant, Ivorydale is purposefully built as a modern manufacturing facility. Designed by one of the nation's foremost industrial architects, Solon Beman, the new plant incorporates the latest designs for the safety and comfort of employees. We spend the next 130+ years expanding these manufacturing principles across the globe. 123A company that puts people firstWhat allows us to be one of the largest consumer goods company in the world is filling our buildings with passionate, inspired, motivated people who believe in doing better than good, every day. OUR FUTURE Diversity in Everything We Do We believe in diversity & inclusion. That’s why we support it however we can—from creating flexible work schedules for our employees to building inclusive playgrounds for children with and without disabilities. Learn more about our efforts. 2005 Women in Saudi Arabia We become the first consumer goods company to be granted a license to hire women in Saudi Arabia. Since then, our Saudi team has made significant progress in incorporating the talents and insights of women, while still respecting cultural norms and values. 1992 Women in Senior Positions The percentage of women filling senior management positions increases from 5% in 1992 to 30% in 2011. That same year, over 43% of new management hires from the past 5 years are women. 1992 LGBTQ+ Rights P&G includes sexual orientation in its Equal Employment Opportunity statement. The following year we support the creation of an internal grassroots organization known as GABLE and its efforts for LGBTQ+ inclusion within the company. 12341962 Diversity Programming Two years before the U.S. government mandates it, we initiate a diversity program for all employees—providing training and support to grow leaders regardless of sex, race, or religious orientation. 1905 Education Equality James N. Gamble helps establish what becomes the Bethune-Cookman University. This is just the beginning to the company’s long tradition of supporting historically black colleges and universities. 12Sustainable steps to a brighter futureA snapshot of all our sustainability achievements and efforts. OUR FUTURE Ambition 2030 During Earth Week in 2018, we released new sustainability goals for 2030 with one purpose in mind: to make a positive impact on our environment while creating value for our consumers. Learn more about our plan to address finite resources and growing consumption. 2016 World's 1st Beach Plastic Shampoo Bottle Head & Shoulders produces a bottle made from up to 25% recycled beach plastic—the first major step in establishing a unique supply chain involving thousands of volunteers and hundreds of NGOs. 2013 Making Zero Waste a Reality We announce during Earth Week that 45 P&G sites around the world have achieved zero-manufacturing-waste-to-landfill status, leading us to set bigger goals for 2030. 2005 Coldwater Technology 80-85% of energy used in the laundry process is used to heat water. After researchers discover the environmental impact of that, we design Coldwater Technology to deliver optimal performance at lower temperatures. 12342003 Environmentally-Responsible Flushables We lead the development of guidelines for flushable products published by The Water Environment Research Foundation. 1989 A New Life for Plastics We start using recycled plastic in our packaging, but our use of recycled polypropylene (PP) is limited due to a lack of availability of high-quality material. We need a solution, so one of our scientists invent a sustainable technology that recycles a type of plastic that wasn’t recyclable before—helping us reduce even more waste. 1983 Reducing Packaging & Water Use Triple Concentrate Downy makes its debut as one of P&G’s first products to reduce packaging and water use. Over the years, we improve this responsible tech across other products like Dawn, Fairy, Tide, and Ariel. 1956 Establishing the Importance of Safety The first environmental safety publication at P&G is published, providing research on surfactants (like emulsifiers, detergents, and foaming agents) in rivers. This topic continues to be important to P&G as demonstrated by the biological monitoring program at our paper manufacturing plants in 1969 and the release of our first Annual Global Environmental Report in 1993. 1234Take a look at where we are todaySee our BrandsCommunity impactWho we areBrandsWho we areCommunity impactSustainability
