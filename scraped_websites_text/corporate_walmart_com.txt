This belief that true leadership depends on willing service was the principle on which Walmart was built, and drove the decisions the company has made for the past 50 years. So much of Walmart’s history is tied to the story of Sam Walton himself, and so much of our future will be rooted in Mr. Sam’s principles. The Road to Walmart Sam Walton was born in 1918 in Kingfisher, Oklahoma. In 1942, at the age of 24, he joined the military. He married Helen Robson in 1943. When his military service ended in 1945, Sam and Helen moved to Newport, Arkansas. During this time, Sam gained early retail experience, eventually operating his own variety store.In 1950, the Waltons left Newport for Bentonville, where Sam opened Walton’s 5&10 on the downtown square. They chose Bentonville because Helen wanted small-town living, and Sam could take advantage of the different hunting seasons that living at the corner of four states had to offer. Inspired by the early success of his dime store, and driven to bring even greater opportunity and value to his customers, Sam opened the first Walmart in 1962 at the age of 44 in Rogers, Arkansas. Changing the Face of Retail Sam's competitors thought his idea that a successful business could be built around offering lower prices and great service would never work. As it turned out, the company's success exceeded even Sam's expectations. The company went public in 1970, and the proceeds financed a steady expansion of the business. Sam credited the rapid growth of Walmart not just to the low costs that attracted his customers, but also to his associates. He relied on them to give customers the great shopping experience that would keep them coming back. Sam shared his vision for the company with associates in a way that was nearly unheard of in the industry. He made them partners in the success of the company, and firmly believed that this partnership was what made Walmart great.As the stores grew, so did Sam's aspirations. In addition to bringing new approaches and technologies to retail, he also experimented with new store formats—including Sam's Club and the Walmart Supercenter—and even made the decision to take Walmart into Mexico. Sam's fearlessness in offering lower prices and bringing Walmart's value to customers in the U.S. and beyond set a standard for the company that lives on to this day. His strong commitment to service and to the values that help individuals, businesses and the country succeed earned him the Presidential Medal of Freedom, awarded by President George H. W. Bush in 1992.It was during Sam's acceptance remarks that he articulated what would come to be Walmart's official company purpose. "If we work together, we'll lower the cost of living for everyone...we'll give the world an opportunity to seewhat it's like to save and have a better life." Today, "saving people money so they can live better" is the driving force behind everything we do. 10 Rules for Building a Better Business Sam Walton believed running a successful business boils down to 10 simple rules and they helped Walmart become the global leader it is today. We continue to apply them to every part of our business.Read his 10 Rules for Building a Better Business. Mr. Sam's Legacy Sam Walton died in 1992, shortly after receiving the Medal of Freedom, but his legacy lives on. To this day, Walmart remains a leader in the retail industry. We are committed not just to expanding the business to better serve our customers, but also to improving the communities we serve through our efforts to constantly improve what we do and how we do it, and through the impacts we're able to achieve through the Walmart Foundation. Through this daily dedication to our business and our customers, we honor Mr. Sam. #f2f2f2 WMT Stock pricing delayed by 20 minutes. © 2025 Walmart Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Animal Welfare Position Sustainable Products at Walmart U.S. and Sam’s Club U.S.: Our Pledge to Customers and MembersOur customers and members count on Walmart U.S. and Sam’s Club U.S. to deliver affordable products in a way that is sustainable for people and for the planet. To meet those needs, we work with collaborators all along the supply chain to improve the sustainability of products we sell. We aim to do this while working to offer quality products, everyday low prices, and putting customers in charge of their food choices by helping provide clear, accurate information about food ingredients and production methods.Farm Animal WelfareCustomers, suppliers, farmers, veterinarians, and NGOs have a shared interest in meeting increasing demand for affordable protein while improving animal welfare. Our stakeholders expect us to work with suppliers to find solutions to address animal welfare concerns in supply chains and to promote responsible antibiotic use. Customers count on us to deliver affordable products that are consistent with their values, aligned with scientific guidance, and support public health.Walmart U.S. and Sam’s Club U.S. PositionWe recognize that farm animals play an important role in providing nutritious meat, dairy, and eggs to our customers and members. We believe that farm animals in our supply chain should be treated humanely throughout their lives and that the welfare of farm animals should be considered in selection of all production systems, practices, and technologies. Walmart U.S. and Sam’s Club U.S. are committed to continuous improvement in the welfare of farm animals in our supply chain.First, we expect that our suppliers will not tolerate animal abuse of any kind.Second, we support both the globally recognized “Five Freedoms"1 and “Five Domains”2 as aspirations for animal welfare in our supply chain:Five FreedomsFive DomainsFreedom from Hunger and Thirst – by providing ready access to fresh water and a diet to maintain full health and vigor.Nutrition – Water and food availabilityFreedom from Discomfort – by providing an appropriate environment including shelter and a comfortable resting area.Environment – Physical and atmospheric conditions to which the animal is exposedFreedom from Pain, Injury or Disease – by prevention or rapid diagnosis and treatment.Health – Absence of disease, injury, and impairmentFreedom to Express Normal Behavior – by providing sufficient space, proper facilities and company of the animal’s own kind.Behavior – Behavioral indicators of the animal’s perception of their circumstancesFreedom from Fear and Distress – by ensuring conditions and treatment which avoid mental suffering.Mental – Overall assessment of welfare based on animal’s subjective experienceThird, we will work with our supply chain partners to implement practices consistent with the Five Freedoms or Five Domains of animal welfare.What We’re Asking of Our SuppliersWe’re asking Walmart U.S. and Sam’s Club U.S. fresh and frozen meat, deli, dairy and egg suppliers to:Adopt and implement the principles of the Five Freedoms or Five Domains in their own operations and industry producer programs, and publish a corporate policy on animal welfareReport to authorities and take appropriate disciplinary and corrective action in any cases of animal abusePromote transparency by providing an animal welfare report to Walmart and publicly reporting against their own supplier animal welfare policies on an annual basisUtilize species-specific industry welfare standards with third party audit (or second party audit with third party sampling) to promote transparency and standardization on welfare approaches3Find and test solutions to relevant focus areas by species, including but not limited to:4SpeciesRelevant industry standard program (or equivalent / advanced)5Relevant focus areas:Broiler ChickensNational Chicken Council Animal Welfare Guidelines• Environment: Housing that enables the expression of natural behaviors (e.g., functional enrichments, friable litter, light/darkness)• Health: Breed selection for strong, healthy birdsTurkeysNational Turkey Federation Animal Care Guidelines• Environment: Housing that enables the expression of natural behaviors (e.g., functional enrichments, friable litter, light/darkness)• Health: Physical alterations managementPorkNational Pork Board Pork Quality Assurance® PlusCommon Swine Industry Audit• Environment: Housing that enables the expression of natural behaviors (e.g., space per animal, functional enrichments)• Behavior: Tools to minimize anxiety and aggression• Health: Physical alterations managementBeef CattleBeef Quality Assurance Program• Supply chain animal welfare traceability• Health: Physical alterations management• Nutrition: Balanced diet with appropriate availability of food and waterDairy CattleNational Dairy FARM Program – Animal Care• Environment: Housing that enables the expression of natural behavior (e.g., space allowance, functional enrichments)• Health: Physical alterations managementLaying HensUnited Egg Producers Certified Animal Welfare Program• Environment: Housing that enables the expression of natural behavior• Health: Gendering innovationIn addition to the above focus areas, we continue to work towards alignment with the Five Freedoms and Five Domains of animal welfare in our egg and pork supply chains:Laying Hen HousingWalmart U.S. and Sam’s Club U.S. are committed to continuous improvement and aspire towards the globally recognized Five Freedoms and Five Domains of animal welfare for farm animals in our supply chain. To meet this aspiration for our egg supply, we continue to work alongside our suppliers on a comprehensive set of welfare priorities for laying hens, including higher welfare housing for laying hens.Our mission to provide quality, sustainably sourced, and affordable products remains our north star. Walmart will continue to engage suppliers and industry stakeholders to advance higher welfare hen housing systems while encouraging cage-free egg sales across our stores and clubs. We invite all stakeholders in the cage-free eggs supply chain to continue innovating production approaches and technologies to provide customers with affordable and sustainably sourced eggs that align with the principles of the Five Freedoms and Five Domains. We will publicly report on the status of cage-free eggs in our supply chain annually.Sow HousingWalmart and Sam’s Club continue to ask our suppliers to find and implement solutions that address animal welfare concerns in line with the Five Freedoms and Five Domains. This includes working with suppliers to adopt sow housing systems that provide comfortable lying areas and positive interactions with other animals and the people who care for them. Group housing for pregnant sows is one such system, defined by the National Pork Board as “a housing environment for more than one sow where, after confirmed pregnant, they have the ability to lie down and stand up unimpeded and to turn around…In group sow housing, sows move about more freely and have social interactions with their pen mates.”We aim to responsibly increase our sourcing of fresh and frozen whole muscle pork from suppliers that house pregnant sows in systems that allow them to lie down, stand up, and turn around unimpeded, while maximizing positive experiences for the sows. We recognize there are times in a sow’s life when individual housing is best for her welfare and the welfare of the herd, such as during breeding and farrowing. In line with industry standards, we expect that sows will be moved from breeding stalls to housing that allows freedom of movement once pregnancy is confirmed. We encourage our fresh and frozen pork suppliers to work to minimize the amount of time pregnant sows spend in breeding stalls, subject to the needs of the individual sow and herd.1Citation: https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukgwa/20121007104210/http:/www.fawc.org.uk/freedoms.htm2Citation: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7602120/3In scope categories: Fresh and frozen whole muscle pork, poultry and beef; fluid dairy milk; shell eggs4In scope categories: Fresh and frozen whole muscle pork, poultry and beef; fluid dairy milk; shell eggs5Equivalent or more advanced programs include but not limited to: Where Food Comes From CARE Programs, American Humane Certified, Global Animal Partnership (GAP), Certified Humane, and Animal Welfare Approved Antibiotics in Farm Animals Position Sustainable Products at Walmart and Sam’s Club | Our Pledge to Customers/MembersOur customers and members count on Walmart and Sam’s Club to deliver affordable products in a way that is sustainable for people and for the planet. To meet those needs, we work with partners all along the supply chain to improve the sustainability of products we sell. We do this while working to offer quality products, everyday low prices and putting customers in charge of their food choices by helping provide clear, accurate information about food ingredients and production.Antibiotics in AgricultureAntibiotics are used in farm animals to treat, control and prevent disease and to promote growth. In the United States, antibiotics must be approved as safe and effective by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Many antibiotics used in animals are also used in human medicine, and are categorized by the World Health Organization as “medically-important antimicrobials."1 Antibiotics are a critical and scarce resource and their misuse may lead to antibiotic-resistance in bacteria, making human and animal disease more difficult to treat. According to the World Health Organization, Antibiotic resistance is a serious and growing threat to global public health.2Walmart U.S. and Sam’s Club U.S. PositionWe expect our suppliers to help protect the integrity of the food we sell by complying with all federal, state and local regulatory requirements as well as Walmart food safety standards. We recognize that antibiotics are one of many critical tools used to keep animals healthy and that they should be used responsibly to preserve the effectiveness of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine. Responsible use begins with the adoption and implementation of judicious use principles, such as those developed by the American Veterinary Medical Association. Judicious use includes disease prevention strategies, appropriate veterinary oversight, accurate record-keeping and careful review before antibiotics are used.Furthermore, we believe that antibiotics should only be used for medical purposes (treatment, control and prevention of disease) and not for growth promotion.Finally, antibiotics should be used transparently to build accountability and public trust in the food system. We support public reporting of antibiotic use. We also support consistency of on-pack product claims in order to ensure clarity and usefulness of information to our customers and members.What We’re Asking of Our SuppliersWe’re asking Walmart U.S. and Sam’s Club U.S. fresh and frozen meat, seafood, deli, dairy and egg suppliers to:Comply with all federal, state and local regulatory requirements as well as Walmart food safety standards.Adopt and implement American Veterinary Medical Association Judicious Use Principles of Antimicrobials3 in their own operations and in their industry producer programs, including but not limited to:Disease prevention strategies;Appropriate veterinary oversight;Accurate records of treatment and outcomes;Careful review before antibiotics are used; andLimit medical antibiotic use to ill or at-risk animals,Adopt and implement U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s Voluntary Guidance for Industry #2094 (Judicious Use of Medically Important Antimicrobial Drugs) in their own operations and in their industry producer programs, including elimination of growth promotion uses of medically-important antibiotics.Eliminate growth promotion uses of all antibiotics.5Promote transparency by providing an antibiotics management report to Walmart and publicly reporting antibiotic use on an annual basis.1WHO Critically Important Antimicrobials for Human Medicine.

California B & P Code #22435 California B & P Code #22435 prohibits the unauthorized possession or removal of shopping carts from Walmart Stores and Sam’s Club premises.

To avoid the worst effects, we all need to act now to sharply reduce greenhouse gas emissions. And business is an essential part of the solution. In 2016, Walmart was the first retailer to announce a science-based target to align with the Paris Climate Agreement, which we recently upgraded to the highest 1.5o C-degree level of ambition.As such, Walmart will advocate for 1.5o C-aligned, science-based national and international climate policies that are consistent with achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 and fairly and equitably address the needs of all stakeholders. We believe market-based, emissions-reduction policies are critical to achieving greenhouse gas emissions reductions necessary to eliminating the worst effects and mitigating the impacts of climate change while supporting economic growth.Walmart’s climate action plan starts with our science-based target for Scopes 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative.1 For our Scopes 1 and 2 emissions, we have committed to an absolute reduction of 35% by 2025 and 65% by 2030, compared to 2015 levels. We are also working with suppliers through our Project Gigaton initiative to prevent one billion metric tons (or a gigaton) of Scope 3 emissions from the global value chain by 2030, compared to a base year of 2015.For the long term, we are targeting zero emissions across our global operations by 2040, without relying on carbon offsets. We plan to achieve this goal by (1) harvesting enough wind, solar and other renewable energy sources to power our facilities with 100% renewable energy by 2035; (2) electrifying and zeroing out emissions from our vehicle fleet by 2040; and (3) transitioning to low-impact refrigerants for cooling and electrified equipment for heating and backup power generation in our stores, clubs and data and distribution centers by 2040.Walmart will continue transparently reporting our climate-related risks and strengthening business resilience to help prepare for the effects of climate change.The Walmart Board of Directors adopted this statement on June 3, 2021. The Board reviews our progress on climate related topics, at minimum, annually.1 Science Based Targets Initiative. Walmart’s Scope 1 & 2 targets have been approved to be consistent with reductions necessary to keep warming below 1.5o C. Walmart’s Scope 3 targets have been approved to be consistent with reductions necessary to keep warming below 2o C. Conflict Minerals Policy The Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) has adopted rules requiring publicly traded companies to report on products they manufacture or contract to manufacture that contain tin, tantalum, tungsten or gold (“3TG” or “conflict minerals”) mined in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries (“DRC Countries”) under circumstances that contribute to or support human rights violations.In association with the Retail Industry Leaders Association’s (RILA’s), we worked with other retailers to produce training materials and tailor the questionnaire originally developed by the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) and the Global eSustainability Initiative (GeSI) to be more specific to retail suppliers. We also engaged third party firms with specialized experience in various aspects of conflict minerals to assist Walmart in the development and implementation of our program, which includes due diligence activities consistent with the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Guidelines.Walmart understands that awareness and cooperation among its supply chain participants is essential to any responsible sourcing initiative. By holding product suppliers accountable for the principles in this policy, Walmart believes its conflict minerals program will help drive necessary transparency in the supply chain and further the ultimate goal of ending armed conflict in the DRC.Walmart expects its product suppliers to actively support Walmart’s conflict minerals compliance efforts by:Adopting responsible mineral sourcing policies in dealing with their supply chains that are consistent with this policy and the OECD guidance,Supplying products to Walmart that do not contain 3TG minerals that have been sourced under circumstances that contribute to or support human rights violations in the DRC, andProviding evidence to support their representations as to the conflict minerals status of their products upon request.See the RILA website for more information about the efforts of the RILA Conflict Minerals Program.

Environmental, Health and Safety Statement Walmart is committed to complying with applicable environmental, health, and safety (EHS) laws and other requirements in the countries where we operate. In each country where we operate retail and/or manufacturing facilities, Walmart has established programs and procedures designed to meet our compliance obligations. This includes reducing the environmental impact of our products and operations, as well as protecting the health and safety of our associates and customers.All Walmart associates are expected to comply with applicable EHS policies, procedures, and legal requirements. Failure to comply may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination. To assist Walmart associates in complying with our EHS policies and local EHS laws, Walmart maintains an EHS Compliance Program that includes policies, standards, procedures, and controls designed to prevent, detect, and remediate non-compliant activities. We aim for continuous improvement of our program, assessing and adjusting it to ensure continued effectiveness.Our EHS efforts focus on:Protecting the environment. Designing our facilities and operating our business responsibly and consistent with environmental obligations helps sustain resources and care for the communities we serve. Associates are expected to follow all environmental policies and procedures applicable to their role and stop any task or activity that may not comply with applicable environmental requirements.Creating a safe workplace. A safe place to work and shop builds trust with our associates and customers. Our associates are expected to:Follow all health and safety policies and procedures applicable to their role.Only perform job functions for which they have been trained and are qualified to perform, including operating machinery, vehicles, and other equipment.Take appropriate measures to reduce the risk of harm to themselves or to others, including restricting access to an area or the equipment when operating machinery or other equipment.Stop any task or activity if working conditions become unsafe and report the concern.Use required personal protective equipment in accordance with local laws and regulations.Be familiar with facility evacuation procedures and follow all applicable emergency response measures. Never block or obstruct emergency exit doors or egress pathways.Reporting concerns. Associates are expected to report any activity or working condition that may pose an unacceptable risk to safety, human health, or the environment immediately to a member of management.Leading by example.

Our EHS Compliance teams around the world are expected to implement appropriate standards and procedures intended to further mitigate risk across our business, in accordance with local laws and policy.Walmart also expects our suppliers, vendors, and service providers to uphold our EHS objectives and obligations. Environmental Sustainability Statement Our Approach to SustainabilityIn 2005, Walmart set out three aspirational goals tied to sustainability: create zero waste, operate with 100 percent renewable energy; and sell products that sustain our resources and the environment. Since that time Walmart has periodically set specific targets aimed at moving the company towards these aspirational goals. In 2020 Walmart raised our ambition and committed us on a path to become a regenerative company. That includes targeting zero emissions across the company’s global operations by 2040 and a commitment from Walmart and the Walmart Foundation to help protect, manage or restore at least 50 million acres of land and one million square miles of ocean by 2030. Walmart is working within our own operations and with suppliers to make progress on our goals. Walmart recognizes having environmental commitments without measuring our progress towards achieving them is not useful. Therefore, Walmart prefers to set measurable targets and publicly report progress on an annual basis in Walmart's Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG) Report. In addition to the specific updates found in the ESG Report, key tenets of our environmental sustainability program are highlighted below.Compliance with LawsAt a minimum, Walmart is committed to complying with applicable environmental, health and safety (EH&S) laws and other requirements in the countries where we operate. Walmart has established programs and procedures designed to meet our compliance obligations.Stakeholder Consultation on Environmental Sustainability InitiativesWalmart seeks to go beyond compliance to shape its sustainability commitments and programs. To achieve this goal, Walmart works with a broad group of stakeholders to advise and shape its environmental sustainability programs. These stakeholders include customers, associates, NGOs, government officials, investors, suppliers, farmers, academics, think tanks, peer companies, grantees and others. By consulting and collaborating with individuals and organizations with broad viewpoints on important issues, Walmart can better form and implement beneficial environmental policies.Promoting Environmental Responsibility in Our Value ChainWalmart is committed to working with our diverse value chain to promote environmental sustainability. For example, Walmart launched Project Gigaton and has asked suppliers to join us in our efforts to remove 1 billion metric tons (Gigaton) of GHG from our value chain by 2030. Through Project Gigaton, Walmart is working with suppliers to help them make meaningful changes that reduce carbon emissions through the six key pillars of Project Gigaton: Energy, Waste, Packaging, Agriculture, Deforestation, and Product Use. We also work to drive change through engagement of suppliers through The Sustainability Insight System (THESIS) Index, a science-based, third-party tool that enables suppliers to report on key performance indicators for the most relevant environmental and social issues across the lifecycle of a product type.Commitment to Reduce Emissions and Waste in Walmart’s OperationsAs we encourage and support suppliers in their efforts to be more sustainable, we realize we must do our part as well. Walmart aims to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions 35% by 2025 and 65% by 2030 from 2015 levels. As part of that effort, Walmart is working to power 50 percent of our operations with renewable energy by the end of 2025 and 100% by 2035. Additionally, Walmart set a goal to achieve zero waste to landfill from our own operations in key markets by 2025 in accordance with Zero Waste International Alliance guidelines.Support and Promote the Development of Transformation Technologies to Make Change PossibleWalmart has long supported innovative technologies that make our operations more sustainable. From being one of the first retailers to move to skylights and LED lighting, solar installations, water efficient bathroom fixtures, smart cooling towers and other transformational technologies, we have also led the way in trucking fleet efficiency by utilizing cutting-edge aerodynamic designs and installing idle reduction systems on our trucks. Walmart is committed to continue working internally and with suppliers to develop and deploy innovative technologies that are designed to reduce our impact on the environment. Firearms and Ammunition Guidelines Updated: Sept. 3, 2019Walmart has a long heritage as a company of serving hunters and sportsmen and women. Our focus has always been to do so responsibly, including taking many measures that go beyond what’s required by law.Where We Sell Firearms and AmmunitionWalmart sells firearms in approximately half of our U.S. supercenter stores. While we are not the largest volume firearms seller in the United States, we do serve many areas of the country where there is a concentration of hunters and sportsmen/women.Items We SellWalmart sells long guns for hunting and sport shooting, including shotguns, single-shot hunting rifles and light sporting rifles, as well as BB and pellet guns.Items We Don’t SellWalmart does not sell military-style rifles, such as the AR-15, or any type of AR-15 accessory, including bump stocks and high-capacity magazines. These items are also listed on our prohibited items list for online marketplace sellers. We have a process to monitor our eCommerce marketplace and help ensure our policies are applied.As of September 2019, we have discontinued the sale of:handguns, which were previously sold only in our Alaska storesammunition for handgunsammunition for short-barrel rifles such as the .223 caliber and 5.56 caliber that, while commonly used in some hunting rifles, can also be used in large-capacity clips on military-style weaponsammunition like the .300 Blackout, 7.62x.39 and .224 ValkyrieWho Can Buy Firearms and Ammunition at WalmartIn February 2018, we announced our decision to sell firearms and ammunition only to individuals who are 21 and older.Walmart only sells a firearm after receiving a “green light” on a background check. This goes beyond federal law, which only requires the absence of a “red light” after a three-business day waiting period. We require a “green light,” regardless of the time period.Selling Firearms ResponsiblyWalmart takes steps above and beyond what is required by law to sell firearms in a responsible way, including:videotaping the point of sale for firearms;allowing only select associates who have passed a criminal background check to sell firearms;conducting regular associate training;performing inventory audits; andsecuring firearms in a locking case, among other important measures.Walmart associates who are authorized to sell firearms are specifically trained on all firearm policies and procedures. Associates who fail to follow the policies and procedures are subject to discipline, up to and including termination.Walmart is a charter member of the Responsible Firearms Retailer Partnership, organized by Walmart and Everytown for Gun Safety.We have committed to work alongside other retailers to make the overall industry safer, including sharing our own best practices. This system navigates tens of millions of possible combinations of federal, state and local laws, regulations and licensing requirements that come into effect based on where a firearm is sold and who is purchasing. We hope that freely sharing this information will help more retailers sell firearms in a responsible, compliant manner.Open Carry of FirearmsMotivated by our desire to create a safe environment in our stores and clubs, we request that customers no longer openly carry firearms into Walmart or Sam’s Club locations in states where open carry is permitted – unless they are authorized law enforcement. As of September 2019, we are working to create and display new signage to help communicate this policy.We will continue to follow state and local laws regarding concealed carry permit holders. Forests Policy Updated: Jan. 31, 2024Walmart Inc. (“Walmart”) aspires to source deforestation-free and conversion-free (“DCF”) products and has developed this policy to articulate our expectations of suppliers in support of that aspiration. The following priority commodities and regions are addressed by this policy:1Palm oil, pulp, paper, and timber from any region sold directly to Walmart or used as ingredients or raw materials in Walmart private brand products;Palm oil from any region used in national brand products sold to Walmart;Beef from the Brazilian Amazon and Cerrado or the Gran Chaco of Argentina and Paraguay (“Priority Regions”) sold directly to Walmart as national brand or private brands products;Soy from the Brazilian Amazon and Cerrado or the Gran Chaco of Argentina and Paraguay (“Priority Regions”) sold directly to Walmart or indirectly as ingredients in Walmart private brand products.Collectively, the commodities listed above represent Walmart’s “Priority Commodities.”In addition to Priority Commodities, Walmart encourages suppliers to adopt DCF sourcing practices in other commodity supply chains including cocoa, coffee, natural rubber, and other forest products.2 We also encourage national brand suppliers, marketplace sellers, and others to commit to DCF sourcing, support practices that eliminate deforestation and conversion risks in supply chains, and transparently report their progress.3Suppliers sourcing Priority Commodities (“Applicable Suppliers”) are expected to abide by the requests of this Forest Policy throughout their business and throughout the process of providing products to Walmart. This includes responsibility for the conduct of any suppliers, subcontractors, and agents they use as part of their Walmart business (including, for example, factories, processing facilities, and raw material, component, and ingredient providers). Any Applicable Supplier that disregards this Forest Policy may be subject to consequences, up to and including termination of business with Walmart. Walmart reserves the right to audit or inspect Applicable Suppliers at any time to determine whether they are abiding by this Forest Policy.Walmart’s aspiration for DCF supply chainsAs part of Walmart’s aspiration to become a regenerative company4, we aim to source from and contribute to the development of DCF commodity supply chains related to the products we sell.As a people-led, tech-powered omnichannel retailer, our purpose is to help people save money and live better. Our customers count on us to deliver affordable products that are more sustainable for people and the planet, through actions that increase transparency and trust. We work with suppliers, NGOs, governments, and others along the value chain to help improve the sustainability of the products we sell.Many of the products we sell include ingredients that come from forests and related ecosystems such as mixed vegetation grasslands. Such ecosystems provide numerous benefits, including support for people that depend on them for their homes and livelihoods, habitat for a vast number of species, and environmental services including the regulation of water and related climate systems (cleaning the air, storing carbon, and moderating rainfall), which are essential for supporting agricultural yields and mitigating natural disasters. Yet, according to the World Economic Forum and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, agriculture expansion and forestry are the main drivers of deforestation and conversion.5Reversing the continued loss of forests and natural ecosystems while continuing to meet the daily needs of people around the world requires sustained transformation of production and sourcing of forest-risk commodities. Such systemic transformation will depend on innovative solutions at the producer, supply chain and landscape levels, requiring collaboration6 among farmers and other producers, commodity traders, product manufacturers, retailers, suppliers, governments, and NGOs. General expectations of suppliersWe expect Applicable Suppliers to implement the following DCF practices when sourcing Priority Commodities (whether as finished good, raw materials or ingredients): Commit to achieving DCF sourcing, with a target date of December 31, 2025, or earlier;7Use a cut-off date of no later than December 31, 20208 to measure and report DCF sourcing;Use the definitions and guidance outlined by the Accountability Framework initiative (“AFi”)9 to support DCF implementation efforts, as well as: Follow all relevant laws and regulations to ensure no illegal harvesting or violations of human rights;10 Protect forests and natural ecosystems, especially High Conservation Value (“HCV”) and High Carbon Stock (“HCS”) areas; Do not develop on peatlands, regardless of depth; Encourage agroforestry and other regenerative practices, wherever possible;Respect the rights of Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities (“IPLCs”), including Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (“FPIC”), where appropriate.Certify or verify DCF sourcing. Walmart recognizes the importance of both sustainability certifications and supply chain verification as key tools to credibly and effectively implement DCF sourcing. Certifications can help improve the sustainability of agriculture and forestry production systems, supporting a wide range of social, environmental, and economic benefits, including DCF criteria. Supply chain verification, using credible geo-spatial monitoring, independent validation, and transparent reporting, can also be an effective tool to deliver DCF sourcing and help advance sustainability outcomes. For the purposes of this policy, Walmart asks Applicable Suppliers to follow the certification and verification practices described below in order of priority:Prioritize the use of credible certifications with traceability and chain of custody models11 that can effectively deliver verified DCF sourcing, when possible;When certification is available but cannot yet provide sufficient traceability of DCF sourcing, use a hybrid approach that combines certification and verification;When certification is not available, verify DCF sourcing12, and promote sustainable agriculture and forestry practices within the value chain that complement DCF criteria. Report progress to Walmart via Project Gigaton or Walmart’s Sustainability Survey to help demonstrate collective progress towards DCF sourcing across Priority Commodities and Priority Regions. Commodity-specific expectations of suppliersWe expect Applicable Suppliers to adopt the following DCF sourcing practices:Palm oilPalm oil is an ingredient in a variety of food and consumer products. It is a highly productive and versatile crop that contributes to smallholder livelihoods and socioeconomic benefits for rural communities. Yet unsustainable palm oil production has been associated with deforestation and peatland conversion, primarily in Southeast Asia.13 Experts suggest this can lead to environmental and social impacts, such as habitat loss, biodiversity declines, greenhouse gas emissions that exacerbate climate change, and air pollution from burnings.14Walmart’s goal for DCF palm oilBy the end of 2025, Walmart Inc. aspires to source only deforestation-free and conversion-free (DCF) palm oil for our private brand products globally. This includes all forms of palm oil used in Walmart’s private brand products, including crude palm oil, refined palm oil, palm kernel oil, fractions, expellers, and derivatives. It also includes palm oil sourced from any region in the world.Walmart’s expectation of private brand suppliers for DCF palm oilWalmart Inc. expects its private brand suppliers globally to:1. Develop and implement a plan to source DCF palm oil, including by:Publishing a DCF commitment aligned to the general expectations above with timebound milestones for sourcing DCF palm oil. We encourage suppliers to consult the Accountability Framework initiative (AFi) for guidance on how to establish a credible DCF policy and implementation plan;Registering DCF commitments in Walmart’s Project Gigaton portal under the Nature Pillar; and Sourcing DCF palm oil following:The principles and criteria of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) with a segregated (or higher) chain of custody model for DCF sourcing; or The principles and criteria of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) mass balance model with DCF verification.152. Transparently report progress, including by: Reporting progress towards sourcing DCF palm oil for private brand products during Walmart’s Sustainability reporting season, including: Total palm oil volumes sourced for Walmart private brand products; Percentage of palm oil volume certified by RSPO Segregated (or higher) chain of custody model; andPercentage of palm oil volume certified by RSPO Mass Balance and verified as originating from sources that were not deforested or cleared after December 31, 2020 (or earlier, as specified by established protocols). Maintaining, and making available upon request, comprehensive records about palm oil sourcing volumes and origins, including concession and mill locations, risk assessments, certification documentation, verification methods for DCF, and other relevant information, as appropriate; andComplying with requests from Walmart to conduct independent validations of sourcing, reporting, and claims with third parties, as needed.To help accelerate progress across the industry, Walmart also encourages all national brand suppliers to source palm oil in accordance with the principles and criteria of the RSPO Mass Balance (or higher) chain of custody model by the end of 2025.BeefBeef is a nutrient-dense high-protein food that is connected to the culture of communities around the world. It also provides livelihoods for many smallholder producers. Yet unsustainable cattle ranching practices have been associated with deforestation and conversion of natural ecosystems, especially in South America.16 Experts suggest this can lead to environmental and social impacts, such as habitat loss, degradation of ecosystem services that regulate temperature and rainfall, greenhouse gas emissions that exacerbate climate change17, conflicts over land and resources, as well as air pollution from burnings18.Walmart’s goal for DCF beefBy the end of 2025, Walmart Inc. aspires to source only deforestation-free and conversion-free (DCF) beef for our private brand and national brand products originating from Priority Regions. This includes fresh, chilled, frozen, and processed corned beef products19, originating from farms or ranches located in the Brazilian Amazon, Brazilian Cerrado, and Gran Chaco of Argentina and Paraguay.Walmart’s expectation of national and private brand suppliers for DCF beefFor beef products originating from Priority Regions, Walmart Inc. expects its private brand and national brand suppliers globally to:1. Develop and implement a plan to source DCF fresh, frozen and processed beef, including by:Publishing a DCF commitment with timebound milestones for sourcing DCF beef. We encourage suppliers to consult the Accountability Framework initiative (AFi) for guidance on how to establish a credible DCF policy and implementation plan. We also encourage suppliers to follow the Beef on Track20 protocol for implementing DCF sourcing in the Brazilian Amazon and other priority regions, as appropriate;Registering DCF commitments in Walmart’s Project Gigaton portal under the Nature Pillar; andUsing credible geospatial traceability, monitoring, and verification to demonstrate DCF sourcing, including both direct and indirect supplying properties.2. Transparently report progress, including by:Reporting progress towards sourcing DCF beef during Walmart’s Sustainability reporting season, including: Total fresh, chilled, frozen, and processed corned beef volumes sourced for Walmart private brand and national brand products from specified priority regions; andPercentage of volumes that are verified as originating from sources that were not deforested or cleared after December 31, 2020 (or earlier, as specified by established protocols); Maintaining, and making available upon request, comprehensive records about beef sourcing volumes and origins, including direct and indirect supplying farms21, slaughterhouse locations, risk assessments, verification methods for DCF, and other relevant information, as appropriate; andComplying with requests from Walmart to conduct independent validations of sourcing, reporting, and claims with third parties, as needed. SoySoy is a high-protein crop that is prevalent in many food and consumer products. It is also a key feed input for aquaculture, poultry, and livestock. Soy is also a highly productive and versatile crop that contributes to livelihoods and socioeconomic benefits for rural communities. Yet unsustainable soy production practices have been associated with deforestation and conversion of natural ecosystems, especially in South America.22 Experts suggest this can lead to environmental and social impacts, such as habitat loss, degradation of ecosystem services that regulate temperature and rainfall, greenhouse gas emissions that exacerbate climate change, conflicts over land and resources, as well as air pollution from burnings.23Walmart’s goal for DCF soyBy the end of 2025, Walmart Inc. aspires to source only deforestation-free and conversion-free (DCF) soy for our private brand products originating from Priority Regions. This includes all types of soy used for food and consumer products as well as soy used in feed for fish, aquaculture, poultry, and livestock associated with our value chain, originating from farms located in the Brazilian Amazon, Brazilian Cerrado, and Gran Chaco of Argentina and Paraguay.Walmart’s expectation of private brand suppliers for DCF soyWalmart Inc. expects its private brand suppliers globally to:1. Develop and implement a plan to source DCF Soy, including by:Publishing a DCF commitment with timebound milestones for sourcing DCF soy. We encourage suppliers to consult the Accountability Framework initiative (AFi) for guidance on how to establish a credible DCF policy and implementation plan;Registering DCF commitments in Walmart’s Project Gigaton portal under the Nature Pillar; and Sourcing DCF soy following: The principles and criteria of the Roundtable on Responsible Soy (RTRS), ProTerra Standard, or Cefetra Certified Responsible Soya Standard, with a segregated (or higher) chain of custody model for DCF sourcing; or The principles and criteria of the Roundtable on Responsible Soy (RTRS), ProTerra Standard, or Cefetra Certified Responsible Soya Standard mass balance model with DCF verification.DCF supply chain verification with independent validation. 2. Transparently report progress, including by:Reporting on progress towards sourcing DCF soy during Walmart’s Sustainability reporting season, including: Total volume of soy sourced for Walmart private brand products from Priority Regions; Percentage of certified volume from certifications that utilize chain of custody models that can credibly deliver DCF soy; andPercentage of volumes that are verified as originating from sources that were not deforested or cleared after December 31, 2020 (or earlier, as specified by established protocols); Maintaining, and making available upon request, comprehensive records of soy sourcing volumes and origins, including locations of direct farms as well as cooperatives and intermediaries, silo and aggregation sites, risk assessments, certification documentation, verification methods for DCF, and other relevant information, as appropriate; andComplying with requests from Walmart to conduct independent validations of sourcing, reporting, and claims with third parties, as needed.Pulp, Paper, and TimberPulp, paper, and timber are important forestry products for a variety of household and consumer items. Forestry is also an important economic resource for many rural communities around the world. Yet unsustainable forestry practices have been associated with deforestation and conversion.24 Experts suggest this can lead to environmental and social impacts, such as the loss of rare, endangered, and ancient trees as well as the loss of habitat, soil erosion and sedimentation of waterways, degradation of ecosystem services, greenhouse gas emissions that exacerbate climate change, as well as social conflicts over land and resources.25Walmart’s goal for DCF pulp, paper, and timberBy the end of 2025, Walmart Inc. aspires to source only deforestation-free and conversion-free (DCF) pulp, paper, and timber for our private brand products. This includes hardwood and softwood logs, sawn timber, furniture, pulp and paper, plywood, particle board, as well as Oriented Strand Board (OSB), Medium and High-Density Fiberboard (MDF and HDF) and other engineered wood products. It applies to all pulp, paper, and timber sourced from any region in the world.Walmart’s expectation of private brand suppliers for DCF pulp, paper, and timberWalmart Inc. expects its private brand suppliers globally to:1. Develop and implement a plan to source DCF pulp, paper, and timber, including by:Publishing a DCF commitment with timebound milestones for sourcing DCF pulp, paper, and timber products. We encourage suppliers to consult the Accountability Framework initiative (“AFi”) for guidance on how to establish a credible DCF policy and implementation plan;Registering DCF commitments in Walmart’s Project Gigaton portal under the Nature Pillar; and Sourcing pulp, paper, and timber as follows and as specified in order of preference below:Use recycled content whenever possible; Source Forest Stewardship Council (“FSC”) certified commodities whenever possible;Where FSC certified commodities are not available at the price, quantity, or specifications needed,26 source commodities certified by Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) or Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC). For SFI, Walmart prefers suppliers source material under SFI’s Forest Management Standard but will accept other forms of SFI certification. For all SFI and PEFC sourcing, we ask suppliers for additional due diligence to verify DCF sourcing;27Where PEFC or SFI certified commodities are not available at the price, quantity, or specifications needed,28 source commodities using DCF verification methods to ensure products do not originate from areas cleared after December 31, 2020.292. Transparently report progress, including by: Reporting on progress towards sourcing DCF pulp, paper, and timber during Walmart’s Sustainability reporting season, including: Total volumes of pulp, paper, and timber sourced for Walmart private brand products. Percentage of recycled material;Percentage of material certified by FSC (specify FSC standard); Percentage of material certified by SFI and/or PEFC (specify SFI and/or PEFC standard); andPercentage of material verified as DCF.Maintaining, and making available upon request, comprehensive records about pulp, paper and timber sourcing volumes and origins, including locations of concessions and mills, risk assessments, certification documentation, verification methods for DCF, and other relevant information, as appropriate.Complying with requests from Walmart to conduct independent validations of sourcing, reporting, and claims with third parties, as needed. Restoring Critical ForestsRestoring degraded or converted forests can generate numerous benefits for people and nature, including re-establishing ecosystem connectivity, increasing wildlife habitat, enhancing biodiversity, improving ecosystem services, increasing carbon sequestration, and strengthening landscape and community resilience.Walmart encourages all private brand and national brand suppliers as well as marketplace sellers to support forest restoration initiatives. We ask our suppliers to join Project Gigaton, set goals on nature and forests, and report progress annually. More information on these types of efforts can be found on Walmart’s Sustainability Hub. Supporting Landscape and Place-Based InitiativesIn addition to the supply chain actions outlined above, Walmart encourages suppliers to engage in place-based initiatives at the landscape and jurisdictional level to help advance regenerative outcomes and build resilience at scale. Place-based initiatives bring together diverse stakeholders to help advance shared sustainability goals. They seek to integrate protection, restoration, and more sustainable management by optimizing across social, economic, and environmental objectives. These approaches offer opportunities to effectively address the underlining drivers of deforestation and the conversion of natural ecosystems and are complementary to the DCF supply chain actions outlined in this policy.Effective engagement in place-based initiatives will vary by landscape, but may include: Joining a landscape or jurisdictional initiative and participating in multistakeholder dialogues, steering committees, working groups, or other forums.Committing to source from jurisdictions and landscapes that are pursuing goals that align with business priorities. Investing in actions that align with the priorities identified by local stakeholders representing the jurisdiction or landscape initiative.Supporting credible and transparent reporting and claims of activities and outcomes at the landscape and jurisdictional level. For more information, please visit the Walmart Sustainability Hub.1 Walmart’s Forest Policy is focused on the following priority commodities and regions: palm oil and pulp, paper and timber globally; as well as beef and soy from the Brazilian Amazon and Cerrado and the Gran Chaco of Argentina and Paraguay. Walmart has prioritized these commodities and regions because of their relative levels of deforestation and conversion risks, our ability to potentially influence DCF production and sourcing practices via our private brand suppliers and in some instances national brand suppliers, as well as the potential to help advance broader collective action via our participation in coalitions like the Consumer Goods Forum Forest Positive Coalition and the Tropical Forest Alliance, which have prioritized the same set of commodities.2 https://www.walmartsustainabilityhub.com/sustainable-products3 National brand suppliers and marketplace sellers are encouraged to use Project Gigaton to set SMART goals, take action, and report progress.4 https://corporate.walmart.com/news/2020/09/21/walmart-sets-goal-to-become-a-regenerative-company5 World Economic Forum and Food Agriculture Organization of the United Nations6 Examples of Walmart’s collaborative efforts include: member of the Consumer Goods Forum Forest Positive Coalition (CGF-FPC), member of the Tropical Forest Alliance (TFA), and as an endorser to the New York Declaration on Forests (NYDF) and the Statement of Support (SoS) for the Cerrado Manifesto.7 Walmart expects suppliers to be able to demonstrate significant progress towards achieving full DCF sourcing for Priority Commodities and Priority Regions by the end of 2025 (or sooner). We also expect ongoing implementation and reporting beyond 2025 to ensure continued alignment with the goals and approaches outlined in this Forest Policy.8 Walmart recognizes earlier cut-off dates that have been established through credible multi-stakeholder processes and/or certification systems. We encourage our suppliers to adopt these earlier dates as part of their implementation of DCF sourcing practices. Where earlier dates do not exist, we expect suppliers to use a DCF cut-off date of December 31, 2020. The Accountability Framework initiative (AFi) has compiled a list of common cut off dates for different commodities and regions that suppliers can reference: https://accountability-framework.org/fileadmin/uploads/afi/Documents/Common_Cutoff_Dates_Sept_2023.pdf9 Applicable suppliers should use the Accountability Framework initiative, within the limits of applicable labor law, to help support their DCF implementation efforts https://accountability-framework.org10 This includes following the requirements of Walmart's Human Rights program, including Walmart's Human Rights Statement and Standards for Suppliers.11 Certification chain of custody models that follow a book and claim or mass balance approach are typically unable to provide credible DCF sourcing without additional verification mechanisms. Mass balance certification models that include DCF controls for mixed products can provide credible DCF sourcing. Certification chain of custody models that follow a segregated and identity preserved approach are typically able to provide credible DCF sourcing without additional verification mechanisms.12 For DCF verification, suppliers should have a public DCF policy and a way to monitor and verify DCF sourcing that enables credible reporting. This may include developing and implementing risk assessments, supplier engagement and site visits, geo-monitoring, traceability, and/or purchase control systems to verify that commodities have not originated from areas that were deforested or cleared after 12/31/20 (or earlier). Monitoring and traceability systems should cover direct and indirect supplies and include ongoing checks to ensure the supplying areas are not associated with forced labor, environmental embargoes, or encroachments on indigenous territories or conservation units, as appropriate by commodity. This may also include transparent methodologies that outline risk levels, spatial mapping resolution, minimum mapping units to assess deforestation and conversion, temporal data layers, and other relevant information used for measurement and validation.13 Izaya Numata et al 2022 Environ.

Indirect supplying farms are properties that sell cattle to other producers or intermediaries, but not directly to slaughterhouses. Cattle ranching can generally be categorized across three distinct phases of production: breeding, rearing and fattening. Direct farms tend to cover the fattening phase, while indirect farms tend to cover the breeding and/or rearing, but some farms cover multiple or all phases of production. Walmart aims to apply DCF sourcing across all phases of production to include both direct and indirect supplying properties from priority regions.22 https://www.worldwildlife.org/magazine/issues/summer-2018/articles/what-are-the-biggest-drivers-of-tropical-deforestation23 https://chainreactionresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Cerrado-Deforestation-Disrupts-Water-Systems-and-Poses-Business-Risks-for-Soy-Producers-3.pdf24 https://wwf.panda.org/discover/our_focus/forests_practice/forestry/pulp_and_paper25 https://www.worldwildlife.org/industries/pulp-and-paper26 If suppliers are unable to viably source material via FSC certification, suppliers should provide a written explanation detailing the reasons why.27 As a member of the Consumer Goods Forum Forest Positive Coalition (CGF-FPC), Walmart seeks to align with the DCF methodologies developed by CGF-FPC, which indicate that SFI and PEFC certifications may not necessarily provide verified DCF sourcing: https://www.theconsumergoodsforum.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/CGF-FPC-PPP-Roadmap-Guidance.pdf28 If suppliers are unable to viably source material via SFI or PEFC certification, suppliers should provide a written explanation detailing the reasons why.29 See footnote 12 for guidance on DCF verification. Fur Friendly Policy Walmart U.S. and Walmart Canada have a fur friendly policy in place. We do not sell products containing genuine animal fur. The following products are excluded from the policy: wool products, shearling and skin (e.g. leather, calf-hair leather, sheepskin and lambskin).

Global Forced Labor Prevention Policy PurposeWalmart respects the basic rights of workers and complies with all applicable laws and regulations in the locations where we operate. The use of any form of forced or trafficked labor anywhere in our own operations and supply chain is prohibited. Walmart will not intentionally use forced labor, including underage labor or involuntary prison labor, and we will take actions to exclude forced labor from our own operations and supply chain.Our Walmart Standards for Suppliers sets our expectations for suppliers of product sold to or sourced by Walmart. Products should not be produced using forced labor, including underage labor or involuntary prison labor. We believe suppliers should cascade these expectations throughout their supply chains—including to raw material, component, or ingredient suppliers. We also expect our third-party service providers to prohibit the use of forced labor, including underage labor or involuntary prison labor, in their operations.Target AudiencePreventing forced labor in our operations and working with suppliers to prevent forced labor is the responsibility of all associates. All associates are expected to comply with this Policy. In particular, any leader or People team member who is in a position to hire workers, especially third-party contract labor, must understand the relevant risks of forced labor. In addition, all merchant and sourcing associates are expected to understand the relevant risks of forced labor. Failure to comply may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.Walmart also expects our suppliers, vendors, service providers, and other third parties to uphold our Forced Labor Prevention principles and compliance requirements. Specific requirements for third parties are included in the Walmart Standards for Suppliers and/or in our contracts and agreements.Forced Labor Prevention PrinciplesFor purposes of this Policy, we uphold the following principles:Recruit responsibly. Workers should not pay recruitment or similar fees to obtain employment, even if the fees are allowed under local law. Workers should be appropriately authorized to work, including meeting local legal age requirements and relevant legal requirements for migrant workers.Communicate and follow the terms and conditions of employment. Terms and conditions of employment should be communicated to workers in a language they understand, and changes should be communicated transparently. Wages should be paid regularly and in alignment with local law. Wages should not be withheld or subject to illegal or excessive deductions. Workers should not be subject to excessive working hours, as defined by local laws and ordinances.Allow workers to have freedom of movement. Workers should have the ability to move freely and should not be restricted by their employer through abuse, physical force, or threats of violence or reprisals. Workers should retain control over their personal identification documents and other valuable possessions. Workers should be free to terminate employment upon reasonable notice.What to DoAll Associates:Know and understand the Global Labor and Employment Policy and the Global Responsible Sourcing Compliance Policy.Escalate concerns of forced labor by contacting a member of management or the Global Ethics Helpline via phone: + 1 (800) 963-8442 (local contact numbers can be found on www.walmartethics.com), web: www.walmartethics.com or email: ethics@walmart.com. We prohibit taking negative action against any individual for reporting in good faith conduct that violates this Policy or cooperating in an investigation.All Managers or People team members in a position to hire associates and contract third-party labor:Follow company procedures and policies relating to hiring, retaining, and promoting talent, as well as all relevant procedures for identifying and managing third party contract labor, and onboarding and managing relationships with suppliers.Do not knowingly:Hire associates who have been recruited under forced labor conditions orAllow contract laborers who are working under forced labor conditions to work at Walmart sites or on Walmart projects.All merchant and sourcing associates:Do not knowingly buy or source from suppliers that are producing products for Walmart using forced labor, including underage labor or involuntary prison labor, in their operations or their supply chain.Communicate expectations and hold suppliers accountable to the Walmart Standards for Suppliers and our Forced Labor Prevention requirements. Global Sanctions Compliance Policy The United States, other countries, and international governmental organizations like the United Nations or the European Union have sanctions programs that prohibit activity with certain countries, or regions (“Prohibited Territories”), governments, entities, and persons (“Restricted Parties”). It is the policy of Walmart Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively “Walmart” or the “Company”) to comply with all applicable sanctions laws and regulations.Prohibited Territories include countries or regions that are subject to comprehensive sanctions prohibiting nearly all activity involving those countries or regions, or those from which sourcing is prohibited by Walmart Policy. Similarly, Restricted Parties are individuals, governments, groups, entities, vessels, or aircraft that are subject to comprehensive sanctions prohibiting nearly all activity with those parties. Suppliers must ensure that the services or products provided to Walmart comply with all restrictions imposed by the United States sanctions, as applicable, or the sanctions of any other relevant government. Walmart expects its suppliers, vendors, service providers, and other third parties to follow Walmart’s commitment to sanctions compliance and not cause Walmart to violate any sanctions law.What to DoIn addition to the requirements included in the Walmart Standards for Suppliers and/or in our contracts and agreements, suppliers must ensure that:They, their beneficial owners, or any other owner, officer, director, employee, agent, or third-party representative acting on their behalf is not listed on any applicable Restricted Party Watchlist, including the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List or other similar applicable lists.Products are not produced—in whole or in part—in violation of the applicable law or in a way that would cause Walmart to violate the law. This includes conducting due diligence to verify the origin of all items or components purchased, and ensuring that they are not grown, produced, manufactured, extracted, processed in, sourced from, or transported through Prohibited Territories. Their operating and sourcing locations, including factories, are not located or incorporated in Prohibited Territories.They comply with, and refrain from any act or omission that would or could cause you or Walmart or any affiliates to violate, any applicable laws relating to economic or trade sanctions, including, without limitation, those administered by the United States, the country in which you reside and/or are located, and the country or countries from which the products are being sent.ReportingTo report suspected violations of this policy, please Report a Concern or contact the Global Ethics Helpline via phone: + 1 (800) 963-8442 (local contact numbers can be found on www.walmartethics.com) or email: ethics@walmart.com. GMO Position Walmart U.S. GMO PositionWalmart has pledged to deliver on trust and transparency for our customers and the communities we serve. We are committed to selling food and products that meet high standards for safety, quality and affordability. Customers are also more interested than they were in recent decades in understanding where their food comes from, what’s in it and how it’s made. Walmart welcomes this development, and we are working on ways to help them make more informed buying decisions. In that regard, we supported legislation passed by Congress in 2016 that provided a uniform standard for the disclosure of bioengineered (BE) ingredients and foods, often referred to as GMOs. We actively worked with our private brand suppliers to meet the disclosure requirements established through the USDA National Bioengineered Food Disclosure Standard.We believe in providing our customers choices when shopping with Walmart. For our customers who prefer to avoid bioengineered foods, we offer a wide selection of USDA certified organic products. By law, bioengineered ingredients are not allowed in the organic program. In FY2020, we started revamping our produce areas that included making organic offerings easier to find, and better highlighting fresh produce prices to emphasize affordability.We require that all suppliers meet USDA and FDA regulations. The USDA and FDA make no nutrition or health distinction between GMO and non-GMO products and ingredients. Government Relations Policy Updated: Mar. 15, 2022Walmart aims to shape public policy that enables our business and the creation of shared value for our customers, associates, suppliers, business partners, communities, and shareholders. Walmart conducts government relations activities in compliance with relevant federal, state/provincial, and local laws. This policy governs our approach to engagement in public policy and applies to all associates who work for Walmart Inc., or one of its subsidiary companies, in the United States and globally where consistent with local law ("Walmart").Interactions With Public Officials and Legislative BodiesWalmart’s Global Public Policy and Government Affairs and Public Affairs and State and Local Government Relations teams in the U.S. and similar government relations professionals in Walmart’s international markets (collectively “Government Affairs”) coordinate company interactions concerning public policy or electoral matters with elected or appointed officials and legislative and regulatory bodies at the global, federal, state/provincial, and local levels. To help ensure consistent management of these relationships and compliance with law, conversations and engagement with government officials or agencies on public policy or electoral matters are to be conducted in coordination with the appropriate Government Affairs contact and in compliance with our Code of Conduct and all other policies, including those governing the giving of anything of value to an official to secure a benefit for Walmart. With the exception of local law enforcement interactions handled by facility operations, contacts with government agencies concerning litigation, enforcement, compliance, and security matters are managed by Walmart’s Global Governance organization. Associates must coordinate with our legal department before engaging in discussions with any government agency on these matters.Associates wishing to represent Walmart’s corporate position on public policy or political matters should seek guidance from Government Affairs before expressing such views. In addition, all such interactions with public officials, including their support staff, should be reported to Government Affairs, as certain contact can constitute “lobbying” in the U.S. and elsewhere which may be reportable.Associates that are located outside the U.S. shall not have any contact with U.S. Federal Government Officials on behalf of the company without the express consent of Government Affairs.Political ContributionsIn the U.S., Government Affairs coordinates the activities and administration of the Walmart Inc., Political Action Committee for Responsible Government (WAL-PAC) and political giving. Government Affairs and WAL-PAC are the only entities authorized to make political contributions on behalf of the Company and in support of our business and all other business segments are prohibited from making political contributions of any kind. Political contributions are made to help elect lawmakers at the state and federal level to make informed decisions on issues critical to the interests of our customers, associates, suppliers, communities and shareholders. We also make contributions to state and local ballot initiative committees critical to those same interests. Decisions about contributions to local, state and federal candidates and committees are made through a formal approval process administered through government affairs that considers criteria including voting records, leadership positions, committee membership, legislative activity and business priority.If you are approached by a political candidate or organization in your store, club or supply chain facility, please contact Home Office Government Affairs at GovernmentAffairs@walmart.com.Please refer any other questions in the area to Government Relations at the email listed above.Fundraising and SolicitationWith respect to fundraising, the following rules shall apply in addition to all applicable laws: Officers of Walmart may distribute political literature or engage in political solicitation, with the approval of an Executive Vice President. Associates assigned to the Corporate Affairs Department may engage in political solicitation or political distribution, as with the approval of the Executive Vice President of Corporate Affairs.Trade and Business AssociationsWalmart participates in a variety of trade associations, business coalitions, and other organizations. Some of these organizations may engage in the development of public policy positions on behalf of their members and/or in activity that may constitute “lobbying” or “political activity” under applicable national, state/provincial or local laws. Walmart annually reviews its memberships in these organizations to determine if any adjustments are needed. Factors considered include the overall value added by the membership and positions taken by the organization on key issues. Associates who are considering Walmart corporate membership in such organizations, or have an ongoing engagement with any such group, shall coordinate this activity with Government Affairs to ensure consistency with Walmart’s approach to public policy and to ensure full compliance with any public disclosure requirements. To discuss or report such an engagement, please contact Home Office Government Affairs at GovernmentAffairs@walmart.com.Board Oversight of Government RelationsThe Nominating and Governance Committee of the Walmart Inc. Board of Directors exercises oversight of Walmart’s government affairs programs. At least once per year, the Committee reviews the topic with management, including the company’s policies, strategies, and activities, including lobbying activities and political advocacy, political contributions, and trade/business association memberships.Transparency and DisclosureWalmart is committed to transparency regarding its public policy strategies and activities. At least annually, Walmart will report on public policy priorities, strategies, and activities, including a list of key trade and business associations in which it is a member or to which it makes contributions and a summary of its state lobbying activities. Additionally, Walmart makes available information on its quarterly Federal Lobbying Disclosure Act reports.For further guidance, contact: Home Office Government Affairs at GovernmentAffairs@walmart.com.For further information on our federal and state policy oriented activities, see our Environmental, Social and Governance Updates for Investors page. Human Rights Statement Commitment to Respect Human RightsWalmart’s business is a people business: we employ millions of people, hundreds of millions of people shop with us weekly, and people work for the tens of thousands of suppliers that make the products we sell. Walmart believes business has a responsibility to respect human rights. Our approach to human rights is grounded in our core values: respect for the individual, service to the customer, striving for excellence, and acting with integrity. We are committed to respecting human rights in our own operations and to making our suppliers aware of our expectation that they respect the human rights of the people who make the products we source and sell. We strive to use our position as an employer, retailer, and community member to promote respect for human rights. We believe Walmart’s business thrives when our associates, people in our supply chain, customers, and our communities thrive. Our approach to human rights is informed by international instruments including, but not limited to, the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Labor Organization’s 1998 Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. We have also considered input from relevant internal and external stakeholders and experts, including rightsholders and human rights NGOs. This statement describes Walmart’s approach to human rights in our operations globally, including all associates at all levels of the organization, as well as our promotion of respect for human rights across our supply chain. It covers Walmart’s approach to due diligence, selection of salient human rights issues, human rights governance, and grievance and remedy processes. Human Rights Due Diligence The U.N. Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights recognize four essential components of an effective human rights due diligence program. Walmart’s approach to human rights due diligence reflects those components: the assessment of actual and potential adverse human rights impacts, integration and acting upon the findings of assessments, tracking the effectiveness of the response to adverse human rights impacts, and communicating how impacts are addressed.Walmart recognizes that vulnerable populations, such as women, children, indigenous peoples, and ethnic and religious minorities, are often the most marginalized and at risk of human rights abuses. Consistent with the U.N. Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, our due diligence efforts focus on addressing the most severe actual and potential impacts on human rights, including paying particular attention to actual and potential impacts on vulnerable populations. As a responsible corporate citizen, we aim to ensure that our business practices do not cause or contribute to existing inequalities and injustices suffered by those groups. Human rights risks are complex and can be the result of systemic issues, making it challenging for any single organization to eliminate those risks itself. Our approach therefore seeks to go beyond our own policies, processes, and business relationships by working collaboratively with other stakeholders to inform our approach and identify root causes; sharing our work with others; and using our leverage to help prevent and mitigate risks and drive positive change. Salient Issues Walmart’s approach to human rights due diligence prioritizes addressing the human rights issues that are most salient to our activities or business relationships. We identify our salient human rights priorities based on factors such as the scale, severity, and likelihood of the potential adverse human rights risk; connection to our business; and Walmart’s ability to drive impact. Salient Issue Key Aspects Treating workers with respect Pay; working hours Freedom of association and collective bargaining Meaningful opportunities for workers to be heard Providing a safe and healthy work environment Physical safety and security of work premises Workplace abuse Healthy work environments Proving a fair and inclusive work environment Anti-discrimination and harassment Belonging, diversity, equity, and inclusion, including but not limited to race, gender, or protected status Combatting forced and child labor Forced, trafficked, child and underage labor Vulnerability of migrant workers, responsible recruitment Using technology and personal data responsibly Data privacy and security Ethical AI and biometrics Transparent use of human-facing technology We respect the fundamental rights of workers as those rights are defined under applicable law in the countries in which we operate and from which we source the products we sell. Those basic rights include freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining, the elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory labor, the effective abolition of child labor and the elimination of discrimination in respect to employment and occupation. We recognize there are different views about freedom of association. Our view is, consistent with applicable law, that Walmart respects the rights of associates to join, form or not to join an employee association or trade union of their choice without interference. Associates should exercise these rights in an informed manner, and with the benefit of thoughtful consideration and available information. In the exercise of these rights, we believe in the free exchange of ideas, opinions and information, provided there is no interference. Human Rights Governance ManagementWalmart’s enterprise risk management process identifies, assesses, and assigns responsibility for managing key risks to the company, including relevant aspects of salient human rights issues. Board of DirectorsThe Walmart Inc. Board of Directors and Board committees oversee and monitor the management of the most significant human rights issues relevant to our company. The Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board is responsible for overseeing Walmart's environmental, social, and governance agenda, including our overall approach to human rights, and receives updates on these initiatives from Walmart's Chief Sustainability Officer. Other Board committees, including the Compensation and Management Development Committee, and Audit Committee—are also charged with oversight of certain salient human rights issues and company strategies to mitigate potential human rights impacts. The Board reviews our progress on human rights, at minimum, annually and aspects of salient human rights issues are often discussed in Board committees. Grievance & Remediation Walmart provides grievance mechanisms which assist in addressing potential human rights issues in both our own operations and our supply chains: these systems aim to help individuals and communities who may be adversely impacted by providing an opportunity to raise their concerns directly with Walmart or the applicable supplier. In our operations, Walmart’s Code of Conduct encourages associates, suppliers, vendors, service providers, business partners, customers, and community members to raise issues, ask questions, and report concerns—including those related to human rights. Walmart associates are encouraged, and in some instances required, to speak up. Cases may be referred to business units for follow-up or investigated by an appropriate team. Violations of our Code of Conduct and Ethics and Compliance program policies can lead to discipline up to and including termination. In our supply chains, suppliers’ employees and workers must be able to raise concerns in good faith and without fear of retaliation. Due to our indirect relationship with workers in supply chains, the primary mechanisms for raising grievances are with the workers’ employers, Walmart’s suppliers, and relevant local authorities. Suppliers must provide a mechanism for workers to report concerns to management, to the supplier, and to third parties such as Walmart. These mechanisms should allow for anonymity and prohibit retaliation for reporting in good faith, including retaliation against third parties such as human rights organizations. Walmart continues to strive to promote the effectiveness of such grievance mechanisms and remedies by supporting opportunities for workers to be heard, communicating expectations to suppliers, and following up on allegations through our case management and investigations process. When issues are reported through the supplier's grievance mechanism, Walmart expects the supplier to promptly resolve the issue. Where issues are raised to Walmart concerning suppliers' operations, we typically work with the supplier toward resolution. We strive to support our supply chain toward compliant operations when possible, in furtherance of our mission to help people “Live Better.”Adopted as amended by the Walmart Board of Directors on September 6, 2024.

Seafood Policy Updated: June 14, 2023Section I: Sustainable Products at Walmart | Our Pledge to Customers/MembersOur customers and members count on Walmart and Sam’s Club to deliver affordable products in a way that is sustainable for people and for the planet. To meet those needs, we work with partners all along the supply chain to improve the sustainability of products we sell. We do this while working to offer quality products, everyday low prices and putting customers in charge of their food choices by helping provide clear, accurate information about food ingredients and production.Section II: Sustainable SeafoodOver the past half century, demand for seafood has increased five-fold. An estimated 75 percent of the world’s fisheries are at or beyond sustainable limits. Meanwhile, an estimated 1 billion people rely on fish as their primary source of protein, while another 200 million rely on the industry as their main source of income.Section III: Walmart’s PositionWalmart aspires to help make choices easier and more transparent for people. We serve hundreds of millions of customers every year, and we advocate for them among suppliers to provide more sustainably produced products while maintaining the low prices customers expect. As part of our efforts to provide our customers affordable, safe, and healthier food, Walmart is committed to expand and enhance sustainable sourcing to cover 20 key commodities.At Walmart, we value our relationships with the seafood suppliers who are dedicated to providing the highest in quality and safety through practices that promote sustainable fisheries and social responsibility. We know that seafood is an important source of protein, nutrition, and income for people all over the world. Therefore, we aspire to find our customers safe, affordable, and sustainable seafood that does not negatively affect global communities or the environment. Our goal is to build transparency and continuous improvement in the seafood supply chain so that we can build confidence and provide for our customers now and in the future.Walmart believes the health of species, fisheries and ecosystems around the world is good for the planet and important to people today and in the future. We are working with our suppliers and partners to track the management of fisheries from which our suppliers source so that we can promote a sustainable supply.In addition, we care about the men and women in our supply chain and in the seafood industry as a whole, and we are concerned about the ethical recruitment and treatment of workers. While this is a complex issue, we are actively engaged in bringing together numerous stakeholders, NGOs and other private sector companies to help find solutions.Section IV: What we’re asking of our suppliersSection IV.1Fresh and Frozen SeafoodBy 2025, based on price, availability, quality, customer demand, and unique regulatory environments across our global retail markets, Walmart U.S., Sam’s Club, Walmart Canada, Walmart Mexico, and Walmart Central America will require all fresh and frozen, farmed and wild seafood suppliers to source from fisheries who are:Third-party certified as sustainable using Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) or Best Aquaculture Practices (BAP), or certified by a program which follows the FAO Guidelines1 and is recognized by the Global Sustainable Seafood Initiative (GSSI) as such. For our farmed supply, we expect suppliers to ensure sustainable production and sourcing throughout the supply chain, including final processing plant, farms, hatcheries and feed mills.ORActively working toward certification or in a Fishery Improvement Project (FIP) or Aquaculture Improvement Project (AIP) that has definitive and ambitious goals, measurable metrics, and time bound milestones.Canned TunaBy 2025, based on price, availability, quality, customer demand, and unique regulatory environments across our global retail markets, Walmart U.S., Sam’s Club, and Walmart Canada will require all canned light and white tuna suppliers to source from fisheries who are:Complying with the International Sustainable Seafood Foundation (ISSF) sustainability conservation measures, including those adopted in collaboration with relevant tuna Regional Fishery Management Organizations (RFMO) and from vessels that are registered on the Pro-active Vessel Register (PVR).ANDThird-party certified as sustainable using Marine Stewardship Council (MSC), or certified by a program which follows the FAO Guidelines1 and is recognized by the Global Sustainable Seafood Initiative (GSSI) as such. Walmart will also source from suppliers using better management fishing practices as validated through chain of custody (e.g. pole and line, free-school sets).ORActively working toward certification or in a Fishery Improvement Project (FIP) that has definitive and ambitious goals, measurable metrics, and time bound milestones.When it comes to the issue of method of catch, Walmart will offer customer choice in select markets, based on local customer preference and market retail norms.Walmart U.S. and Sam’s Club offer customer choice by carrying FAD-free lines of canned tuna.Section IV.2Tuna – Fresh/Frozen and Shelf StableBy 2027, based on price, availability, quality, customer demand and unique regulatory environments across our global retail markets Walmart U.S., Sam’s Club U.S. and Walmart Canada will require all fresh, frozen and shelf stable tuna suppliers to source exclusively from vessels that have 100% observer monitoring1 (electronic monitoring or human observer). Acceptable forms of observer coverage include practices recognized or required by a governmental authority with jurisdiction over a fishery, or by the International Sustainable Seafood Foundation where no governmental standards apply. The requirement for observer monitoring does not apply to tuna fished by pole and line or hand line gear types.Transshipment involves the transfer of fish or fish products from one fishing vessel to another vessel at sea or in port. At-sea transshipment can prevent the collection of accurate data about seafood products, and provide opportunities to hide illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing activities.2 Transshipment in any maritime zone incurs risks, but the risk of undesirable activity is typically greatest on the high seas. While in-port transshipment reduces the risk of certain actors engaging in or concealing undesirable activities, risk can be further mitigated by offloading tuna vessels in port with 100% observer monitoring. In addition to mitigating risk, monitored dockside offloading may provide a range of socio-economic benefits including local employment and reduced costs of goods.To address the risk of high seas transshipment in our supply chain, by 2027, based on price, availability, quality, customer demand and unique regulatory environments, Walmart U.S., Sam’s Club U.S. and Walmart Canada will require all fresh, frozen and shelf-stable tuna suppliers to source from fisheries using zero high seas transshipment, unless the transshipment activity is covered by 100% observer monitoring (electronic monitoring or human observer). All suppliers are encouraged to report on transshipment rates at sea or in port and minimize the practice of high seas transshipment to the fullest extent possible.1Walmart defines observer monitoring as the practice of collecting scientific, technical and relevant compliance information on commercial fishing activities at sea, such as data on catch, fishing effort and bycatch. Observer monitoring may be carried out by human observers or electronic monitoring systems that continuously record data during fishing trips using technology such as data sensors, video cameras, and GPS. 2Source: https://www.iss-foundation.org/glossary/transshipment/Section V: Responsible SourcingWalmart’s commitment includes respecting the dignity of those who grow, catch and produce products for our customers. That is why Walmart suppliers globally—including seafood suppliers—are expected to comply with Walmart’s Standards for Suppliers and applicable Responsible Sourcing program requirements. Walmart’s Standards for Suppliers set out our expectations of suppliers and their facilities regarding the ethical treatment of workers, workplace safety, environmental responsibility, and appropriate business practices. The Standards apply throughout the supply chain, including vessels, hatcheries, feed mills, farms, and final processing facilities. Walmart expects its suppliers to be transparent, to disclose facilities consistent with policy and make all facilities available for audit or inspection at any time, and to commit to continuous improvement. Suppliers are also encouraged to involve themselves in Walmart-led or -supported industry initiatives focused on improving responsible sourcing in seafood supply chains.

Sustainable Chemistry Commitment Walmart customers expect products that are safe, affordable and sustainable. Sustainable Chemistry is the design of chemical products and processes that reduce or eliminate the use or generation of hazardous substances, both to humans and the environment. To minimize the negative environmental and social impact, Walmart has developed a policy on sustainable chemistry for its consumables/Health & Wellness business that focuses on transparency, advancing formulation, and begin labeling private brand products in accordance with the U.S. EPA’s Design for the Environment Safer Product Labeling.Beginning in January 2015, Walmart expects all suppliers will provide full online public ingredient disclosure for formulated consumable items sold at Walmart and Sam’s Club. For private brands, Walmart partnered with the WERCs—a vendor supporting Walmart’s chemical safety and regulatory compliance—to house all proprietary product formulations. Supplier formulations remain confidential from Walmart. Through the WERCS, Walmart private brand suppliers reviewed and approved their in-scope products ingredients in compliance with either U.S. EPA's Design for the Environment Standard for Safer Products or CSPA's Consumer Product Ingredient Communication Initiative. Ingredient information for Walmart private brand products within the scope of the policy will be made available on Walmart.com and Samsclub.com items pages.The following categories of ingredients are commonly protected as trade secrets. When ingredients in these categories are trade secrets, they should be disclosed as follows: Dyes and colorants: should be listed by a chemical-descriptive name. In some cases, Walmart’s private brand products may list colorants that vary by product. Fragrances: Scent ingredients may be listed as "Fragrance," on the label, but the formulator must indicate where detailed information can be found. View Walmart’s Fragrance palette for private brands.The Walmart Sustainability Index will measure supplier compliance with the policy. If a formulated consumable product is missing its online ingredient disclosure, please email sustainabilityassessment@wal-mart.com.For more information on the Sustainable Chemistry Commitment, please visit the Walmart Sustainability Hub. Sustainable Row Crop Position Statement Sustainable Products at Walmart U.S. and Sam’s Club U.S.Our customers and members count on Walmart and Sam’s Club to deliver affordable products that are also sustainable for people and for the planet. Through actions that build transparency and trust, we work with suppliers, NGOs, and governments, all along the supply chain to improve the sustainability of the products we sell. We do this while offering quality products at affordable prices with a time-saving shopping experience.Worldwide, social and environmental losses are escalating. From resource-heavy farming that deplete soil and water resources to the destruction of biologically diverse rainforests, every day the balance of our world’s vulnerable ecosystems becomes more unstable. Our natural systems are telling society we are not doing enough – we’re actually doing irreversible damage to our planet and the natural systems we rely on.Our Commitment to RegenerationWalmart U.S. and Sam’s Club U.S. are committed1 to becoming a regenerative company—one dedicated to placing nature and humanity at the center of our business practices. Our vision is to help transform product and food supply chains to be regenerative. That is why in September 2020, Walmart, Sam’s Club, and the Walmart Foundation made a commitment to protect, manage or restore at least 50 million acres of land and 1 million square miles of ocean by 2030 related to ecosystems that produce food and other consumer products.Regenerating means restoring, renewing, and replenishing in addition to conserving. It means adopting practices in row crop agriculture that build soil health and protect nature, helping promote improved economic and environmental outcomes while contributing to the prosperity and equity of customers, associates and the people who participate in our product supply chains.Sustainable Row CropsSuccessfully transitioning to a system that is less resource-intensive and built on a foundation of healthy soil and long-term productivity will require the active support of all participants in the agricultural system, including farmers, food processors, distributers, retailers, consumers, government, and those who work with farmers.Walmart U.S. and Sam’s Club U.S. believe this transition depends on the adoption of best practices for soil, nutrient, pest, water, and land management. Greatly accelerating the adoption of these practices across our supply chains will build a dependable supply chain that can strengthen our ability to continue helping people save money and live better.Walmart U.S. and Sam’s Club U.S. PrioritiesWe understand that our aspiration to become a regenerative company means leveraging our position as trusted retailers and brands to accelerate the adoption of best practices in row crop agriculture. We believe we can deliver the greatest impact by:Working within the supply chain to help producers adopt best practices,Supporting and enabling transparency,Building structures to enable Walmart and Sam’s Club and the supply chain to track and report progress,Investing in place-based approaches for critical landscapes.2Through our membership in the Midwest Row Crop Collaborative, we will continue to work with leaders across the agricultural supply chain and NGO community to develop and scale up new approaches to farming that build soil health and long-term productivity, protect water, address climate change, and support farm families.A wide variety of farming practices can drive improved environmental and economic outcomes in row crop production. Often, these practices are geographically dependent. Accordingly, we will encourage adoption of the following farming practices in our supply chain where appropriate as well as encourage suppliers to support the practices that could prove most impactful locally.Walmart U.S. and Sam’s Club U.S. Position on Row CropsBest Management Practices for consideration to adopt:Soil and Nutrient ManagementCover crops – Plants that are planted to cover the soil between crop cycles primarily to manage soil erosion, improve soil health, enhance water availability, smother weeds, control pests and diseases and increase biodiversity. Cover crops may have additional benefits such as increasing soil organic matter, improving crop yields, increasing soil organic carbon, and attracting pollinators.3Conservation tillage – Practices that reduce or eliminate tillage of a field, resulting in reduced erosion and improved soil structure, and leaving at least 30 percent of the soil surface covered by residue to reduce soil loss.4,5Crop rotation - Planting different crops sequentially on the same plot of land to improve soil health, optimize nutrients in the soil, and combat pest and weed pressure.6,74R nutrient management – Is a strategy for the application of commercial fertilizers, manure, amendments, and organic by-products to agricultural landscapes to provide plant nutrients. A common framework for optimizing nutrient management is known as the “Four Rs”:Right amount - the proper rate of application;Right source - applying the proper type;Right placement - using the appropriate method for application;Right timing - applying at the correct time in the lifecycle of the system.8Pest ManagementIntegrated Pest Management (IPM) – A sustainable, science-based, decision-making process that combines biological, cultural, physical, and chemical tools to identify, manage and reduce risk from pests and pest management tools and strategies in a way that minimizes overall economic, health and environmental risks.9 IPM relies on pest monitoring and forecasting, use of economic/damage thresholds, integrating chemical and non-chemical strategies and choosing the most effective, least-risk options.Beneficial insect habitat – Developing a diversity of flowering native or naturalized plants, which provide food for beneficial insects (predators and parasitoids), and undisturbed egg-laying and nesting sites for reproduction and overwintering to encourage beneficial insect populations which reduce pest pressure.10,11 The same habitat features also provide food and nesting resources for pollinators.Water ManagementImplement water management plan – Optimizing farming techniques, decisions, and management to limit impacts that the water use and discharge will have on the watershed, community health, and regional ecology by assessing operation needs, identifying needs of other water users in the basin (including nature as a user, e.g., minimum required flows), comparing to total available renewable water,12 and designing interventions and adjusting water uses to bring water use into the boundaries of the basin.Land ManagementHedgerow plantings – Dense woody vegetation planted in a linear design to protect water quality and provide shelter for wildlife.13Riparian corridor – Management practices that create and maintain areas that extend down into the groundwater, up above the canopy, outward across the floodplain, up the near-slopes that drain into the water, laterally into the terrestrial ecosystem and along the watercourse at a variable width.14Grassed waterways – Grassed waterways are constructed graded channels that are seeded to grass or other suitable vegetation. The vegetation slows surface waterflows and the grassed waterway conveys the water to a stable outlet at a non-erosive velocity.15Constructed wetlands – Artificial wetlands created to treat agricultural wastewater using natural functions of vegetation, soil, and microbial populations.16Priority Area ProtectionAbstain using recently converted land – Row crops should not be planted on land that was recently cleared of native vegetation (e.g. grasslands or forests) even if sustainable farming practices are followed after a cutoff date. Sector-wide cutoff dates may differ across commodities and regions. In lieu of a sector-wide conversion cutoff date, a cutoff date no later than the date that Walmart U.S. and Sam’s Club U.S. issue this guidance should be used as the cutoff date, after which land should not be converted for row crop production.17 Sustainable practices that occur on recently or newly converted grasslands, peatlands, wetlands, or forests do not qualify towards Walmart U.S. or Sam’s Club U.S.’s nature aspirations.Agriculture conservation easement – Protect, restore and enhance wetlands, grasslands, forests, or working farms and ranches through voluntary, legal agreements to permanently limit land usage to protect its conservation values.18Supporting Landscape Place-Based ApproachesWalmart U.S. and Sam’s Club U.S. encourages suppliers, aggregators, and commodity companies to engage in place-based approaches (both at the jurisdictional and landscape-level) to leverage positive change beyond individual supply chains and help accelerate sustainable and regenerative commodity production systems at scale.A placed-based approach to natural resource and community issues refers to land and natural resource planning efforts that bring together diverse individuals, values, uses, experiences and activities tied to a specific geographic location. The essential idea behind place-based programming is that caring about places is important and different than just caring about resources. When successful, a placed-based approach will protect multiple resources within an area, create holistic strategies for improvement, focus on diverse stakeholder engagement, and promote a broad range of positive outcomes by addressing underlying conflicts.19These actions vary by jurisdiction and region, but could include:Becoming involved in a jurisdictional initiative by participating in steering committees or engaging in multi-stakeholder dialogue.Committing to source from jurisdictions and landscapes that are pursuing, or have implemented, regenerative agriculture practices.Providing funds and/or technical support to producers, extension centers, projects, and local initiatives working to promote regenerative agriculture.For more information, please visit the Walmart Sustainability Hub.What We’re Asking of Our SuppliersWalmart U.S. and Sam’s Club U.S. understand that cooperation among suppliers is essential to the success of any responsible sourcing initiative. We encourage product suppliers to actively support our sustainable row crop efforts by:Implementing sustainable management practices, as applicable, across the management areas of soil & nutrient, pest, water, and land as outlined above.Sourcing commodities that meet certification standards that Walmart U.S. and Sam’s Club U.S. accepts as credible and impactful, or where certifications are unavailable, produced using regenerative practices with positive outcomes for nature, people, and the economy.Joining Project Gigaton, setting goals to restore agriculture in the Nature Pillar of the portal and reporting progress annually.1 Regeneration Speech2 Walmart Sustainability Hub3 SARE4 SARE5 Purdue6 SARE7 Rodale Institute8 UC Davis9 IPM10 NRCS11 Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation12 Non-Renewable Water Defined13 NRCS14 USDA15 NRCS16 GWPP17 AFi18 NRCS19 Placed-Based Planning Walmart Code of Conduct Global Ethics is responsible for promoting Walmart’s culture of integrity.

Walmart U.S. Pollinator Health Position In 2020, Walmart committed to becoming a regenerative company. As part of this commitment, Walmart and the Walmart Foundation aim to help protect, manage, or restore at least 50 million acres of land and one million square miles of ocean by 2030.According to the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), pollination is important for maintaining the populations of many plants and is critical in agricultural systems. About 75 percent of the world’s major crops are dependent on pollinators,1 and they contribute to the subsistence agricultural production that feeds many millions of people.2 Therefore, a substantial decline in pollinator (e.g., bees, beetles, birds, butterflies, bats, moths, wasps) populations may threaten food production for both local consumption and global food markets. Research by IPBES confirms that wild pollinators have declined in abundance and diversity in regions including North America because of factors such as land-use change, intensive agricultural management and pesticide use, environmental pollution, invasive alien species, pathogens and climate change.Also, according to IPBES, pollinator exposure to pesticides can be reduced by minimizing the use of pesticides, incorporating alternative forms of pest control, and adopting a range of specific application practices. Actions to reduce pesticide use include promoting Integrated Pest Management (IPM); a sustainable, science-based, decision-making process that combines biological, cultural, physical, and chemical tools to identify, manage and reduce risk from pests and pest management tools and strategies in a way that minimizes overall economic, health and environmental risks, as defined by the IPM Institute of North America.As part of our commitment to protect and restore natural resources involved in production of the products we sell, Walmart U.S. is taking these initial steps to promote pollinator health:1. Walmart U.S. will source 100% of the fresh produce and floral we sell in our in-store Produce department from suppliers that adopt integrated pest management practices, as verified by a third-party, by 2025. We also encourage fresh produce suppliers to report their pesticide application and biodiversity management annually, through Walmart’s annual sustainability surveys.Third-party certifications that verify IPM adoption or that are protective of pollinator health and include robust IPM criteria include:Bee Better CertifiedBee Friendly Farming – Third-Party VerifiedCanadaGAP Pollinator Health AddendumEquitable Food Initiative (with Pest Management Standards v3.0)Fair Trade International – Hired LaborFair Trade USA – Year 6 and beyondFlorverde Sustainable FlowersGlobal G.A.P. Integrated Farm Assurance (Fruit and Vegetable Versions 5.3-GFS and above. Flowers and Ornamental Version 5.2 and above)Healthy GrownLEAF MARQUEMPS ABCMPS GAPPrimusGFS (with Module 9 – IPM Practices)Rainforest AllianceSQF Sustainability Integrated Pest Management AddendumSustainable Food Group Sustainability StandardSustainably Grown (SCS Global Services)USDA certified organic, as well as international equivalentsAdditional third-party certifications may be added to the above list as they are able to demonstrate improvements to their IPM criteria.As part of this initiative, we will also encourage fresh produce suppliers to phase out use of chlorpyrifos and nitroguanidine neonicotinoids (imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, clothianidin, dinotefuran) where applicable unless mandated otherwise by law, and to avoid replacing them with other products with a level I bee precaution rating.2. To help improve and expand pollinator habitats, Walmart U.S. will:a. Encourage fresh produce suppliers to protect, restore, or establish pollinator habitats by 2025 on at least 3% of land they own, operate, and/or invest in (e.g., community gardens, pollinator-friendly solar,3 sustainable landscapes4). Suppliers are encouraged to report annual progress through Walmart’s annual sustainability surveys.b. Encourage live-plant suppliers to label pollinator-friendly plants (plants grown without neonicotinoids, flupyradifurone and sulfoxaflor) for sale in our retail stores.c. Continue to avoid selling invasive plant species based on recognized regional lists.d. Help educate customers about pollinator plants for home gardens. In the spring of 2021, more than 1.3 million annual and perennial neonic-free plants for sale in our stores will carry tags to help customers identify plants that attract pollinators. We will explore other initiatives, online and in store, to engage and educate customers.e. Explore opportunities to incorporate pollinator habitat on Walmart U.S. real estate or in local communities, including:Our new Home Office: The “Big Nature” landscape of the new Walmart Home Office campus includes features to support local populations of plant pollinators: for example, we anticipate that over 75% of the plant species will be pollinator-friendly plants (providing the food and habitat pollinators that wildlife like bees, butterflies and birds rely on); and we intend to include pollinator-friendly meadows near waterways (providing undisturbed pollinator foraging habitat as well as water access and the potential for more intentional nesting habitat spaces for insects, small animals and birds).Our stores and other facilities: On an opportunistic basis, we intend to establish pollinator habitats at locations where feasible. For example, 21 Walmart stores have onsite pollinator gardens; and our renewable energy team is working with solar developers to plant pollinator habitats where feasible, such as the solar project at our Distribution Center in Laurens, SC.1 Klein et al, Importance of Pollinators in Changing Landscapes for World Crops, 2006. 2 IPBES, The Assessment Report on Pollinators, Pollination and Food Production of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), 2017. 3 UVM Extension, Land under and around solar arrays can be planted with pollinator-friendly vegetation. 4 A place where people steward natural capital alongside sustainable production systems at a scale that encompasses multiple levels of governance, a wide range of uses, and essential natural capital, to enhance long-term human well-being in a changing world.

That means offering the right products at the right prices, but it also means listening to our customers and evolving to meet their needs. Whether it's families shopping for household essentials or businesses purchasing office supplies, we’re here to make life easier, more affordable and more connected.For the many businesses we serve, that commitment extends beyond just great products — it’s about providing the right tools, insights and solutions to help them operate efficiently and grow. To better understand the needs of small and medium businesses (SMBs) and nonprofits, Walmart Business commissioned a survey1 of nearly 500 decision-makers. The results were clear: growth is the priority, but operational challenges are holding them back.Our survey results indicated that for most SMBs, sales and marketing are the top focus areas for 2025, but they anticipate that nearly 40% of their workweek will be spent on administrative tasks like:Managing spend and cash flow (79%)Managing inventory (65%)Managing payroll (51%)That’s time pulled away from attracting customers and driving growth — the things that matter most.We heard loud and clear that SMBs need better tools to save time, cut costs and operate more efficiently. When we dug deeper, four key themes stood out:Better inventory solutions: One-in-three businesses surveyed rely on “out of stock” triggers to reorder, rather than structured monitoring or automation.More online options: A majority of those surveyed plan to keep or increase their purchasing mix from marketplaces in 2025, as a powerful alternative to managing multiple direct supplier relationships. Cost-efficiency is key: 75% of SMBs surveyed actively look for membership rewards and discounts when making routine purchases.Faster fulfillment matters: Bulk orders and same-day delivery are must-haves for routine purchases such as tech, supplies and workplace food needs.How Walmart is helping SMBs find smarter, more cost-effective solutionsThrough Walmart Business, we’re making it easier for businesses to streamline operations with features designed to cut costs and simplify purchasing:Multi-user accounts, shared payments and subscriptions, so teams can manage spending more effectively.Access to our 1P and Marketplace assortment, offering tens of millions of business-relevant products at competitive prices with pick-up and delivery options, including same-day.Walmart Business+ perks, including spend analytics and management tools, free shipping and 2% rewards on orders of $250 or more2 — helping businesses maximize every dollar.We’re not just offering products. We’re helping SMBs operate smarter, faster and more efficiently.Scaling up: How Walmart Marketplace helps SMBs find new customersWalmart Business is one piece of how we support businesses. Whether it’s stocking the right products, offering operational tools or helping businesses reach more customers, we’re committed to providing solutions that drive success.For businesses looking to increase sales and expand their reach, Walmart Marketplace offers real opportunities to grow by selling to both consumers and businesses. Our Marketplace is expanding quarter over quarter, year over year — which means more opportunity for sellers on our Marketplace. We’re building a full ecosystem to help sellers succeed, including:Advanced tools to drive brand visibility.Dedicated support to optimize performance.Resources designed for long-term success.In our Walmart Marketplace Seller Center, sellers can access tools to elevate their Search Engine Marketing (SEM) to help them reach a broader audience. Through this centralized platform, businesses can:Advertise product listings with Google Shopping Ads, reaching beyond Walmart to millions of Google users.Maximize return on ad spend (ROAS), since Marketplace sellers see an average ROAS of 4:1 through seller-funded SEM.3Whether it’s Walmart Business, our growing Marketplace or one of our other B2B offerings, we’re committed to helping businesses thrive.By delivering affordable products, streamlining operations and offering revenue-generating and brand boosting opportunities, we’re giving SMBs the support they need to grow, adapt and stay competitive — no matter where they are in their journey.That’s the Walmart way.1 Walmart Business commissioned a survey of SMB and non-profit decision-makers with Morning Consult.

It’s these personal traditions that make the day special. And according to our 50,000-member-strong Member’s Mark Community, I’m not alone in that feeling.This year, we’re shaking up tradition by turning the classic menu into an all-day grazing experience — a shift inspired not by trends, but by what our members truly crave. We've tapped directly into how they celebrate, what matters most to them, and the new traditions they’re embracing.What did they tell us? That they want delicious options for feasting and for grazing, that it’s not just about one meal, and that it’s about creating a day-long experience filled with food, fun and community. We went all in, creating an Easter shopping experience that includes brunch essentials, all-day snacking favorites and grilling must-haves for effortless gatherings with friends and family.Brunch, snacks and seconds — an Easter that never endsOur biggest takeaway from our Member’s Mark Community was that Easter isn’t just one meal anymore. Members told us they want to start the day with a big, satisfying brunch and then graze throughout the day, mixing sweet and savory bites. That insight led us to create versatile, high-quality solutions that transition effortlessly from brunch spreads to mid-afternoon snacks to evening indulgences, like:Member’s Mark Egg Bites: a café-quality, high-protein brunch option made with uncured bacon, three cheeses and cage-free eggs.Charcuterie for Every Occasion: Whether it’s a classic meat and cheese spread, a muffin board, or an Easter treat tray, members agree: if it’s on a board, it’s better. That’s why we’re offering curated essentials to build the perfect spread for any grazing style.Club of the Community Delights: Indulge in our curated regional favorites tailored to please members across all locations. From the delectable Blueberry Pie for our Northeast Region to the irresistible Cherry Pie for our other members, our selection is sure to satisfy any craving.This all-day approach means no one’s tied to the kitchen, and every moment — from morning coffee to late-night leftovers — gets its perfect pairing. Choose Your Easter Adventure From brunch spreads to candy and decor, build your perfect celebration with member-loved picks. Shop now The 10-guest sweet spotOur members love to entertain, and this year, it’s all about smaller, meaningful gatherings. Our data shows that most members plan to host around 10 guests, with 85% preparing a meal and 60% hosting in their own home.That shift shaped the way we thought about our Easter assortment— focusing on quality flavors with effortless prep, so hosts can spend more time enjoying the celebration.Fire up the grill: Ham, ribeye and a new Easter classicWith Easter falling later this year, grilling is back on the menu. While ham remains a holiday staple, we saw a demand for more variety — and 20% of beef eaters told us they’d rather serve ribeye. The result? A protein selection that gives every host the perfect centerpiece for their Easter table, whether they’re going classic or carving up something unexpected.From seasonal to signatureWhile members are all about creating new traditions this year, we will still have some classic go-tos. Our Member’s Mark Mac and Cheese remains a must-have for Easter tables everywhere, while the Member’s Mark Carrot Cake, originally a seasonal favorite, has now become a year-round staple thanks to overwhelming demand.Easter, the members’ wayOur member-driven approach to Easter means we’re not just stocking pantries or setting tables, we’re delivering an experience designed by our members, for our members. From grazing-friendly options to stress-free hosting solutions, we’re making it easier than ever to celebrate all day, your way. At Sam's Club, our dedication to our members goes beyond seasons; it's a promise we keep all year long. #f2f2f2 WMT Stock pricing delayed by 20 minutes. © 2025 Walmart Inc. All Rights Reserved.
