The Coca-Cola System THE COCA-COLA SYSTEM We are a global business that operates on a local scale, in every community where we do business. We are able to create global reach with a local focus because of the strength of the Coca‑Cola supply chain, which comprises our company and our bottling partners worldwide. While many view our company as simply "Coca‑Cola," our system operates through multiple local channels. The primary way that our products reach the marketplace starts with Coca‑Cola, which manufactures and sells concentrates, beverage bases and syrups to bottling operations. Coca‑Cola also owns the brands and is responsible for consumer brand marketing initiatives. Our Coca‑Cola bottling partners manufacture, package, merchandise and distribute final branded beverages to our customers and vending partners, who then sell our products to consumers. All bottling partners work closely with customers â grocery stores, restaurants, street vendors, convenience stores, movie theaters and amusement parks, among many others â to execute localized strategies developed in partnership with our company. Customers then sell our products to consumers at a rate of 2.2 billion servings a day. How We Operate The Coca‑Cola Company markets, manufactures and sells: Beverage concentrates and syrups; and,Â Finished beverages (including sparkling soft drinks; water, sports, coffee & tea; juice, value-added dairy & plant-based beverages; and emerging beverages). The CocaâCola Company and its bottling partners are collectively known as the Coca‑Cola system. The CocaâCola Company does not own, manage or control most local bottling companies. In our concentrate operations, The Coca‑Cola Company typically generates net operating revenues by selling concentrates and syrups to authorized bottling partners. Our bottling partners combine the concentrates with still and/or sparkling water, and/or sweeteners, depending on the product, to prepare, package, sell and distribute finished beverages. Our finished product operations consist primarily of company-owned or -controlled bottling, sales and distribution operations. Bottling Investments Group Our current footprint of bottlers exists in South East and South West Asia and parts of Africa. We continue to drive strong performance within BIG while maximizing the returns on our investments. We continue to aspire to be the worldâs smallest bottler by looking for the right partner, at the right time, with the right value proposition.

The Birth of a Refreshing Idea - News & Articles The Birth of a Refreshing Idea Coca‑Cola History The product that has given the world its best-known taste was born in Atlanta, Georgia, on May 8, 1886. Dr. John Stith Pemberton, a local pharmacist, produced the syrup for Coca‑Cola, and carried a jug of the new product down the street to Jacobs' Pharmacy, where it was sampled, pronounced "excellent" and placed on sale for five cents a glass as a soda fountain drink. Carbonated water was teamed with the new syrup to produce a drink that was at once "Delicious and Refreshing," a theme that continues to echo today wherever Coca‑Cola is enjoyed. Dr. John Pemberton Dr. John Stith Pemberton, a local pharmacist, produced the syrup forÂ Coca‑Cola, and carried a jug of the new product down the street to Jacobs' Pharmacy, where it was sampled, pronounced "excellent" and placed on sale for five cents a glass as a soda fountain drink. Thinking that "the two Cs would look well in advertising," Dr. Pemberton's partner and bookkeeper, Frank M. Robinson, suggested the name and penned the now famous trademark "Coca‑Cola" in his unique script. The first newspaper ad for Coca‑Cola soon appeared in The Atlanta Journal, inviting thirsty citizens to try "the new and popular soda fountain drink." Hand-painted oilcloth signs reading "Coca‑Cola" appeared on store awnings, with the suggestion "Drink" added to inform passersby that the new beverage was for soda fountain refreshment. During the first year, sales averaged a modest nine drinks per day. Dr. Pemberton never realized the potential of the beverage he created. He gradually sold portions of his business to various partners and, just prior to his death in 1888, sold his remaining interest in Coca‑Cola to Asa G. Candler. An Atlantan with great business acumen, Mr. Candler proceeded to buy additional rights and acquire complete control.

The History of the Coca-Cola Contour Bottle The History of the Coca‑Cola Contour Bottle The Creation of a Cultural Icon A Refreshing Legacy One of the most famous shapes in the world is the iconic contour fluted lines of the Coca‑Cola bottle. Renowned as a design classic and described by noted industrial designer, Raymond Loewy as the âperfect liquid wrapper,â the bottle has been celebrated in art, music and advertising. When Andy Warhol wanted a shape to represent mass culture, he drew the bottle and when Volkswagen wanted to celebrate the shape of the Beatle, they compared the car to the bottle. How did the bottle become so iconic? It began with the desire to protect brand Coca‑Cola and was a cooperative project between The Coca‑Cola Company and its bottlers. Â An Iconic Beginning In 1899, two Chattanooga lawyers, Joseph Whitehead and Benjamin Thomas, traveled to Atlanta to negotiate the rights to bottle Coca‑Cola. The product had been an increasingly popular soda fountain drink established a mere 13 years previously. In fountain form, Coca‑Cola grew from an average of nine drinks per day sold in 1886 to being sold in every state of the US by 1900. Thomas and Whitehead wanted to capitalize on the popularity of the drink by bottling it to be consumed outside the four walls of a soda fountain. The contract the two signed was a geographic one and The Coca‑Cola Bottling Company began franchising the rights to bottle Coca‑Cola in cities across the U.S. By 1920, over 1,200 Coca‑Cola bottling operations were established. Sales in both fountain and bottle form continued to increase and that popularity led to dozens of competitors trying to imitate the famous trademark of Coca‑Cola to deceive the public into buying their drinks. The bottles used in those days were simple straight-sided bottles that were typically brown or clear. The Coca‑Cola Company required that the bottlers emboss the famous Coca‑Cola logo onto every bottle. However, competitor brands like Koka-Nola, Ma Coca-Co, Toka-Cola and even Koke copied or only slightly modified the Spencerian script logo. These competitor bottles created confusion among consumers. While The Coca‑Cola Company began litigation against these infringements, the cases often took years and the bottlers were constantly asking for more protection. As a first step to help the bottlers, in 1906, TheÂ Coca‑Cola Company introduced a diamond shaped label with a colorful trademark to stand out from the infringers. Unfortunately,Â Coca‑Cola was often sold out of barrels of ice-cold water that would cause the labels to peel off. Some competitors like Koca-Nola even imitated the label as well! Innovative Solutions By 1912, The Coca‑Cola Bottling Company sent a note all of its members noting that while TheÂ Coca‑Cola Company had a distinctive logo, they did not have any way to protect their business. They proposed the members all join together and develop a âdistinctive packageâ for their product. They worked with Harold Hirsch, the lead attorney for TheÂ Coca‑Cola Company to best determine how to get a special bottle. In 1914, Hirsch made an impassioned plea for the bottling community to unite behind a distinctive package. âWe are not buildingÂ Coca‑Cola alone for today. We are buildingÂ Coca‑Cola forever, and it is our hope thatÂ Coca‑Cola will remain the National drink to the end of time. The heads of your companies are doing everything in their power at considerable expense to bring about a bottle that we can adopt and call our own child, and when that bottle is adopted I ask each and every member of this convention to not consider the immediate expense that would be involved with changing your bottle, but to remember this, that in bringing about that bottle, the parent companies are bringing about an establishment of your own rights. You are coming into your own and it is a question of cooperationâ. On April 26, 1915, the Trustees of theÂ Coca‑Cola Bottling Association voted to expend up to $500 to develop a distinctive bottle for Coca‑Cola. So, eight to 10 glass companies across the U.S. subsequently received a challenge to develop a âbottle so distinct that you would recognize if by feel in the dark or lying broken on the ground.â With that simple creative brief, the competition was on. Â Roots in the Root Glass Company In Terre Haute, Indiana, the Root Glass Company received the brief and had a meeting to begin to work on their design. The Root team was composed of C.J and William Root, Alexander Samuelson, Earl Dean and Clyde Edwards. Samuelsson, a Swedish immigrant who was the shop foreman, sent Dean and Edwards to the local library to research design possibilities. When the team came across an illustration of cocoa bean that had an elongated shape and distinct ribs, they had their shape. The team developed the bottle idea and Dean carefully sketched the now recognizable shape onheavy linen paper and under Samuelssonâs direction, a few sample bottles were struck. The Root Glass Company put forth a patent registration under Samuelssonâs name which was granted on November 16th, 1915. That date was later incorporated into the lettering on the final design of the bottle. It is interesting to note that the patent submission was made without the signature embossedÂ Coca‑Cola script lettering. This was done to protect the secrecy of the design and the ultimate client. In early 1916, a committee composed of bottlers and Company officials met to choose the bottle design. The Root version was the clear winner and TheÂ Coca‑Cola Company and the Root Glass Company entered an agreement to have six glass companies across the U.S. use the bottle shape. The contract called for the bottles to be colored with âGerman Greenâ which was later called âGeorgia Greenâ in homage to the home state of TheÂ Coca‑Cola Company. It also called for the name of the city which was placing the glass order to be embossed on the bottom of the bottle. These city names entertained consumers for decades and led to kids to compare whose bottle was from further away for generations. The weight of glass was to be no less than 14.5 ounces, which when filled with the 6.5 ounces ofÂ Coca‑Cola meant each bottle weighed more than a pound! Â Bringing Everyone on Board Even though the bottle had gone into production in early 1916, not all bottlers immediately jumped to change out their glass stock. For many bottlers, the glass bottles were the most expensive portion of their business and they needed to be convinced to make the change. The company began to do that with national advertising featuring the exclusive bottle. The first national calendar featuring the bottle appeared in 1918 and by 1920, most of the bottlers were using the distinctive bottle. In 1923, the patent for the bottle was renewed. It was the custom of the patent office to issues the patent on the Tuesday of each week. For the 1923 patent, that Tuesday just happened to fall on December 25! As the new patent was issued, the date on the side of the bottle was changed to December 25th, 1923 and the bottle was quickly nicknamed the âChristmas Bottle.â Patents expire after 14 years (the bottle patent was renewed again in 1937,) by 1951, all patents on the shape had expired. The company approached the Patent Office that the bottles shape, âdistinctively shaped contour,â was so well known that it should be granted Trademark status. While it was highly unusual for a commercial package to be granted that status, on April 12th, 1961, theÂ Coca‑Cola bottle was recognized as a trademark, in part bolstered by the fact that a 1949 study showed that less than 1% of Americans could not identify the bottle of Coke by shape alone. Now you know why the bottle happened, so how has it permeated culture over the years? Â A Cultural Impact The Coke bottle has been called many things over the years. One of the more interesting of the nicknames is the âhobbleskirtâ bottle. The hobbleskirt was a fashion trend during the 1910s where the skirt had a very tapered look and was so narrow below the knees that it âhobbledâ the wearer. The bottle was also called the âMae Westâ bottle after the actressâs famous curvaceous figure. The first reference to the bottle as a âcontourâ occurred in a 1925 French Magazine, La Monde, which described theÂ Coca‑Cola bottle with a distinctive contour shape. To the general public, the shape is just âthe Coke bottle.â One of the interesting notes about the shape is that while it is almost universally recognized, the form has evolved over the years. Just as the original patent from 1915 was a slightly fatter shape than the bottle that went into production, todays aluminum bottle is a 22nd century update of the classic design. When King and Family sized packaging were introduced in 1955, Raymond Loewy was part of the team that worked to recast the bottle but still keep the proper proportions. The Company took advantage of this classic shape on the cover of the 1996 Annual Report when we placed a silhouette of the bottle with the caption, âQuick, Name a Soft Drink.â While Andy Warhol is the artist most known for using the Coke bottle in art, the first popular artist to incorporate the bottle in a painting was Salvadore Dali, who included a bottle in his 1943 work, Poetry in America. Later artist like Sir Eduardo Paolozzi also used the form in the late 1940s. Robert Rauchenberg includedÂ Coca‑Cola Bottles in his 1957 sculpture, AÂ Coca‑Cola Plan. However, Warholâs use of the bottle in his 1962 show, The Grocery Store, cemented the âpop artâ movement and enshrined the bottle as a favorite or succeeding generations of artist. Warholâs quote from his 1975 book, The Philosophy of Andy Warhol, sums up the artist's choice of the bottle to represent mass culture. âWhat's great about this country is that America started the tradition where the richest consumers buy essentially the same things as the poorest. You can be watching TV and see Coca‑Cola, and you know that the president drinks Coke, Liz Taylor drinks Coke, and just think, you can drink Coke, too. A Coke is a Coke and no amount of money can get you a better Coke than the one the bum on the corner is drinking. All the Cokes are the same and all the Cokes are good. Liz Taylor knows it, the president knows it, the bum knows it, and you know it.â The contour-shaped bottle will always be synonymous with Coca‑Cola, but the Company will continue to innovate and evolve to meet future needs.Â Related Content Coca‑Cola Collaborates with Tech Partners to Create Bottle Prototype Made from 100% Plant-Based Sources Read More Coca‑Cola Launches âReal Magicâ Brand Platform, Including Refreshed Visual Identity and Global Campaign Read More Iteration, for Good: How Project Last Mile is Supporting COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution in Africa and Beyond Read More

Agriculture AGRICULTURE Cultivating Ingredients Better We source a wide range of ingredients from agricultural raw materials such as sugarcane, sugar beet, corn, fruits, coffee, tea and soybeans as well as pulp and paper from complex global supply chains and an expanding range of new ingredients like nuts, herbs and dairy.Â The quality and integrity of our products depends on a sustainable supply chain with successful and thriving farming communities and ecosystems.Â We believe investing in agriculture creates a nexus for solutions on interrelated issues such as human rights, water security, climate resilience, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction and womenâs empowerment. We work with our suppliers and a range of partners to help create systemic change in our agricultural supply chain. 64% of our global priority ingredient volumes were sustainably sourced to our leader standard* in 2023, in line with our Principles for Sustainable Agriculture (PSA) Ensuring these ingredients are produced in a way that respects farmworkers and their communities while also protecting ecosystems is important to us.Â *Leader standard represents supply volume verified to a company-approved, third-party validation that is aligned with our PSA. Explore our Progress Principles for Sustainable Agriculture (PSA) We seek to work with suppliers in support of our Principles for Sustainable Agriculture (PSA), which communicate our expectations for environmental, social and economic performance for our agricultural suppliers to enforce with the farms that are selling them commodities for processing Read Our Principles Engaging our suppliers Through internal Coca‑Cola initiatives and programs with our suppliers and other third-party stakeholders, we continually seek to increase compliance with the Leader standard for the sourcing of our agricultural ingredients. We do not buy agricultural raw materials directly from farms, but mostly processed and refined ingredients from suppliers. Therefore, it is very important to us to work with our suppliers to engage their farm base, with an emphasis on collaboration and continuous improvement.Â Â We are also committed to collaboration across the wider industry and support credible third-party standards to simplify assurance and certifications for the farmers in our supply chain. For example, the Farm Sustainability Assessment of the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative (SAI) Platform, the Bonsucro sustainable cane standard and Rainforest Alliance certifications are three of the leading standards we support.Â Â In addition, we engage directly with farmers in key sourcing regions to help address material issues in our agricultural supply chain. Connections to Other Sustainability Priorities Our agriculture strategy is linked to our other priority workstreams including water, emissions, waste, womenâs empowerment and human rights. Promoting Resilience Agricultural practices play a vital role in promoting resilience across our supply chain and in the communities that provide our agricultural ingredients. By investing in more water-efficient irrigation practices, our suppliers help future-proof their production to the vagaries of changing climate and rainfall patterns. By encouraging other farm practices, our suppliers increase the carbon storage capacity of their soils and limit runoff into water courses. Learn More Water We support better water management across the farm, for example by enhancing soil organic matter to hold more moisture, improving soil structure to help prevent flooding and erosion, and by improving irrigation efficiency. This also helps mitigate the effects of drought and supports the resilience of farmers and farming communities. Learn More Emissions Agriculture is a source of greenhouse gas emissions. The practices encouraged in our Principles for Sustainable Agriculture are designed to reduce those emissions and to support healthy soils that ultimately will be capable of sequestering and storing carbon. Read More Animal Health & Welfare Our business is working constantly to offer consumers new, great-tasting products. We are actively working with our global dairy businesses and suppliers on implementing relevant farm standards and procedures and to develop continuous improvement plans. Together, with internal and external stakeholders we developed our Animal Health and Welfare principles. We also collaborate with other companies in the SAI-Sustainable Dairy Partnership to develop an industry-wide dairy sustainability model. Learn More Human Rights Respect for human rights is woven through what we do at The Coca‑Cola Company. In line with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, we carry out human rights due diligence to identify actual or potential human rights impacts across our value chain.

Principles for Sustainable Agriculture (PSAs) Principles for Sustainable Agriculture (PSA) 04/08/2021 The Coca‑Cola Company is dedicated to working toward more ethical and sustainable sourcing of its agricultural ingredients. The Principles for Sustainable Agriculture (PSA) are the next iteration from the Sustainable Agriculture Guiding Principles (SAGP) and describe The Companyâs first principles for sustainable agriculture based on environmental, social and economic criteria. The PSA reflect the most recent science and external stakeholder perspectives, includes animal welfare and husbandry to reflect new product categories, and simplify language where possible. The PSA are aimed at primary production level (i.e. farm), are inclusive of small-scale farmer cooperatives, medium and large commercial operations, and form the basis for our continued engagement with suppliers to achieve compliance, transparency and continuous improvement of their farm base according to these principles. They will also guide our continued collaboration with industry platforms and standard bodies to drive the adoption of sustainable agriculture practices in the production stage of our supply chain. Agricultural suppliers at the processing level are expected to adhere to and demonstrate compliance to The Coca‑Cola Company Supplier Guiding Principles. The PSA apply to all our agricultural product and packaging materials of agricultural origin. The âPSA Governance Framework and Implementation Guideâ further describes the processes and criteria by which The Coca‑Cola Company and system operationalize these principles to advance compliance with its vision on sustainable agriculture. Human and Workplace Rights The Human and Workplace Rights principles apply to all workers on the farm, industrial processes associated or transport services. All direct suppliers, intermediary processors, producing farms and labor agencies are expected to respect human rights and the below principles in line with international Human Rights principles and The Coca‑Cola Company Supplier Guiding Principles. 1. Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining:Â Respect workers right to form, join or not to join a labor union without fear of reprisal, intimidation or harassment. Where workers are represented by a legally recognized union, establish a constructive dialogue with their freely chosen representatives and bargain in good faith with such representatives. 2. Prohibit Child Labor, Forced Labor and Abuse of Labor:Â Adhere to minimum age provisions for all permanent, temporary or seasonal workers in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations. Minimum age for hazardous work is 18. Prohibit the use of all forms of forced labor, including prison labor, indentured labor, bonded labor, military labor, slave labor or any form of human trafficking. Retention of personal identity documents, recruitment fees or excessive loan terms are prohibited. All children under 15 living on farms have access to schooling. 3. Eliminate Discrimination:Â Maintain workplaces that are free from any discrimination (examples include: gender, race, religion, culture, health status) or physical, sexual or verbal harassment. Women, minorities, migrant workers, indigenous and tribal populations, and other vulnerable groups are treated fairly and equally. The basis for recruitment, placement, training, compensation and advancement should be qualifications, performance, skills and experience. 4. Work Hours and Livelihoods:Â Operate in full compliance with all applicable wage, work hours, overtime and benefits laws and regulations. Compensate workers relative to the industry and local labor market. Farmer income and worker wages should meet at least basic income needs and, where available, be benchmarked against living wage estimates. Workers are offered opportunities to develop their skills and capabilities and provided advancement opportunities where possible. 5. Health and Safety:Â Ensure productive workplace by minimizing the risk of accidents, injury and exposure to health risks. Occupational, health and safety risks are managed through Health & Safety management plans. Provide and require the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Provide trainings on health and safety, including the use of PPE. All workers have access to drinking water, toilets and hygiene facilities and are made aware of medical care facilities. All worker accommodations provided by employer are safe, sanitary and in line with applicable standards outlined in ILO Recommendation 115 (Workers Housing). 6. Grievance Procedure and Remedy:Â Provide workers and communities with a mechanism to express grievances anonymously without fear of reprisal, and ensure concerns are appropriately addressed in a timely manner. Ensure remediation and grievance procedure are aligned to UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. 7. Community and Traditional Rights:Â Recognize and safeguard the rights of indigenous peoples and local communities to land and natural resources, with particular attention to marginalized groups, such as women and ethnic minorities. Where applicable, uphold principle of Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC). Maintain positive community relations and contribute to local economic development. Environment and Ecosystems Agriculture and livestock production should be resilient, environmentally sustainable, cause minimal damage, and, where possible, be restorative to the surrounding environment in all areas and activities on the farm. 8. Water Management:Â Ensure long-term sustainability of water resources in balance with community and ecosystem needs by measuring their water use and quality where crops are irrigated, maximizing water use efficiency and minimizing water quality impacts from wastewater discharges, erosion and nutrient/agrochemical runoff. Farms located in water-stressed areas actively manage their source water to highest standards (e.g. using Alliance for Water Stewardship) and build resilience to climate change by managing for uncertainty, extremes and gradual change. Farms avoid converting important water-related areas (e.g. wetlands). 9. Energy Management and Greenhouse Gas Reduction:Â Avoid contributing to climate change by measuring energy use and greenhouse gas emissions (including emissions from deforestation and other land use change), setting GHG reduction targets, maximizing energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy, reducing emissions from agricultural practices and livestock farms, and avoiding air pollution. 10. Climate Change Resilience:Â Farms have assessed climate-related risks and have climate adaptation and resilience plans in place to appropriately address current and anticipated impacts of climate change while avoiding additional harm to nature or people. 11. Waste Management:Â Separate, classify, safely store, transport and dispose of all waste. Reduce, reuse and recycle waste, where possible, and no waste is incinerated on farm or disposed via freshwater ecosystems (rivers, lakes, etc.). Leakage of plastics, liquid waste or manure from farms into soil or watercourses are prevented. Containers for hazardous materials are disposed of appropriately. There are measures to properly manage organic waste with the goal of enhancing soil health, including through composting. All waste is managed separately according to its classification and disposed of in an authorized place or through waste disposal authorized service providers. 12. Conservation of Forests:Â Promote sustainable forest management and help protect woodlands from deforestation and illegal harvesting. New production areas are not established in natural habitats/ecosystems including forests or high-value conservation areas and do not cut through wildlife corridors or routes used for migration. Forests are not cut or burned for conversion to new production. There is no deliberate use of fire for land clearance. 13. Conservation of Natural Habitats, Biodiversity and Ecosystems:Â Identify and help protect natural habitats from conversion. Natural ecosystems are not altered or burned for conversion to new production. Promote and protect natural habitats, protected areas and biodiversity, including natural pollinators, through the protection, and where possible, restoration of ecosystem services through approaches that build resilience to shocks and longer-term climate stressors. Farms take special measures to protect threatened or endangered species. 14. Soil Management:Â Maintain and improve soils and prevent degradation, minimize greenhouse gas emissions, protect soil biodiversity and enhance soil structure. Implement a Nutrient Management Plan based on an integrated Nutrient Management approach and incorporate the âFour Rs of nutrient stewardshipâ to maintain and enhance soil quality and minimize impacts on air, water and biodiversity. 15. Agrochemical Management:Â Follow national and/or local regulations and label requirements for safe and proper use of all agrochemicals, in accordance with label directions, to ensure proper protection of farm personnel and the environment. Do not use or store agrochemicals that are banned in the country of operation or are prohibited under international treaty. All agrochemicals are managed in a manner that respects Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs) of the countries where agricultural materials are grown and â when possible â of the countries where they are being used as ingredients to help prevent negative impacts on human health. All products used to protect crops from pest pressures, including, but not limited to, insects, weeds and diseases, are clearly documented and are part of an Integrated Pest Management System. All use of plant protection products is clearly justified. Animal Health and Welfare Animal health and welfare principles apply to all animals on a farm, including animals used for harvest or transport work, or as livestock to produce agricultural ingredients or products for the Coca‑Cola Company. 16. Animal Health and Welfare:Â Animals are treated with care, understanding and respect by qualified personnel. Ensure animals are healthy and there is an effective health care program in place. Animal Welfare practices on the farm follow the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code including the âfive freedomsâ: freedom from hunger and thirst; freedom from discomfort; freedom from pain, injury or disease; freedom to express normal behavior; freedom from fear and distress. Workers receive regular training on animal health and welfare expectations. 17. Animal Nutrition and Feed Management:Â Animals are provided with the feed and water of suitable quantity and quality. Feed suppliers can track ingredients to the sourcing farm or region. The nutrient provision, sustainability and safety of feed is ensured by ensuring farms producing ingredients for animal feed meet the PSA. Feed is stored in conditions to ensure quality and avoid contamination. 18. Manure Management:Â Manage manure to avoid contaminations to product or environment and to avoid discomfort to animals. Incorporate manure-management best practices to minimize environmental impacts and limit nutrient losses in collection, storage, treatment, transfer and utilization. 19. Transportation Management:Â Organize transportation of animals to minimize animal discomfort, to avoid creation of injury and distress and to ensure no disease transmission. Farm Management Systems Management systems are in place and records maintained to help ensure: the health, safety and integrity of all products and ingredients; and the business integrity and economic sustainability of the farm system. 20. Business Integrity and Economic Sustainability:Â Conduct business with integrity, respecting relevant laws and prohibiting bribes and fraudulent practices. Know the cost of production, and manage farms to increase productivity and profitability, helping ensure long-term viability and improve resilience to climate, market and other changes. Work collaboratively with others to address shared challenges and broaden their sustainability practices. 21. Food Safety and Hygiene:Â Food safety and hygiene processes are in place in accordance and compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and to ensure safety and quality of food in the supply chain. Appropriate processes and risk assessments are in place to avoid and minimize the bio-chemical and physical risks through production and handling. 22. Harvest and Postharvest Handling:Â Manage harvest and postharvest packing, storage and transportation processes effectively to minimize losses and waste along the value chain. 23. Reproductive Material Identity, Selection and Handling:Â Ensure crop and livestock selection is suited to local conditions (climate, water availability, pest pressure, etc.) to help ensure sustainable harvests and productivity over time. Know the animal and crop species and varieties, if applicable. Farms maintain records and are able to evidence their GMO/GMO-free status. Where GMOs are used, this is in line with regulations. Natural genetic diversity is conserved. 24. Management Systems, Record Keeping and Transparency:Â Develop a system to manage objectives, procedures and practices and to track sustainability practice improvement over time. Maintain records of practices and procedures, as well as proof of compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Increase transparency throughout the supply chain and work collaboratively to adopt and broaden sustainable practices. Set targets for improvement.

Vlad said Coca‑Cola was drawn to the OREO brandâs recent track record of playfully infiltrating pop culture through unexpected collaborations and seasonal innovations. âOREO has emerged as one of the worldâs most beloved Gen Z brands by continually pushing the boundaries of flavor innovation that affirm its credentials as the worldâs favorite cookie,â she noted. âWeâre proud of the collective bravery our two brands have shown in letting our distinct IP be molded and changed in different ways. We believe âReal Magicâ happens in unexpected moments of connection. And this is definitely unexpected.âÂ Coca‑Cola Creations is about establishing firsts and taking the brand into new spaces. This latest drop represents several firsts for the platform: its first food partnership, first TV commercial and first attempt to reimagine tastes fans know and love. âCreations, to date, has brought fantasy flavors to consumers,â Vlad said. âBut in this case, people have a very distinctive notion and mental benchmark of what Coca‑Cola and OREO cookies taste like. So, we were challenged with delivering an experience that will delight fans of both brands.â The launch is also the largest Coca‑Cola Creations partnership, by far. Coca‑ColaÂ® OREOâ¢ Zero Sugar will hit stores beginning in September in 35 markets worldwide, including the United States, Canada, China, Mexico and Brazil. A frozen variation of Coca‑ColaÂ® OREOâ¢ Zero Sugar will also be available at participating 7-Eleven locations in select markets.
